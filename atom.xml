The grey badge verification request takes around 48 hours and the blue badge verification request needs around 3 to 45 days to receive the Facebook response. In case, your verification request is rejected, it is due to the following reasons.</p><pre><code>  * **Press releases or marketing is less** \- When your press is less, it is highly possible that your verification request is rejected as your business or page is not identified accurately. You must learn to get featured on Techcrunch, Forbes, etc. You can also [write a press release to get exposure](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-press-releases-examples-templates/). You may also hire my digital marketing agency for the same.  * **Your Wikipedia is missing** \- In order to create a Wiki; you firstly require the high-quality press.  * **Your identity proof is not up to the mark** \- When your reason for verification request is not very compelling or the ID provided by you is blurry or inappropriate, your request may get rejected.  * **Missing Facebook Native Content** \- Facebook hates a dead page. So, it is important that your page is filled with relevant and great content for long.  * **Verification is Strict** \- Facebook only verifies the popular pages and profiles easily if you can establish your popularity. It is very strict on who they verify.</code></pre><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424527">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424527">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424527.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424527%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424527/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification"><a href="#Part-5-3-Tips-to-Get-Facebook-Verification" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification"></a>Part 5: 3 Tips to Get Facebook Verification</h2><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135366/19272" target="_top" id="2135366">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135366" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="160" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135366/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information"><a href="#1-Provide-complete-and-detailed-information" class="headerlink" title="1.

Being a versatile social media application, there is one feature that makes it even better: the ability to upload stories. <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook stories <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> stay for only 24 hours, which is good if you want to upload a quick photo, video or write something that reflects your current status. Other than posting pictures on your profile that stay for everyone to see for as long as you want, stories work a bit differently, which is it lasts only for 24 hours and vanishes automatically.</p><p>Just like you can upload something on your story for others to see, you can also see others’ stories. This brings us to the question if there is a way to view someone’s stories without letting them know that you have checked them out? Well, yes, you can <strong>view Facebook stories anonymously</strong> by following a few tricks. What happens is that when you check someone’s story, they can check who has viewed it. Then, to view the stories, you need to go to the home page and click on any story on the top that you want to see. Since you want to become the anonymous <strong>Facebook story viewer,</strong> let’s find some techniques to do that.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: How to View Someone’s Facebook Story Anonymously</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: How Do I See Someone’s Story on Facebook Normally</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How to Check Who Have Seen My Facebook Story</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: FAQs About Viewing Facebook Story</a></li></ul><hr><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

So, what happens is that when the Airplane Mode is enabled, and you check a story, Facebook will fail to register your account as one of the <strong>Facebook story viewers.</strong> This is a pretty easy technique. Here’s how you need to apply this method.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iOS or Android device’s Facebook account. Once you are there, log in using your credentials, and then you will see the home page and, on the top, will be the stories of different people.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, turn on the airplane mode to go offline, and then open the home page again and click on any story you want to see. The story will begin to play.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/view-facebook-story-anonymously-via-offline.jpg"                      alt="View Facebok Story anonymously via offline "                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136620/26400" target="_top" id="2136620">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136620" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136620/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Once you are done, force close the Facebook application so that it doesn’t run in the background when you disable the Airplane Mode. Because if you do that, your name can get registered. So, close the app completely. Please note that when the Airplane mode is on, some stories will not load. To watch them, you need to turn on and off the airplane mode again.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1983549">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1983549">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1983549.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1983549%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983549/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Half-Swipe"><a href="#Method-2-Half-Swipe" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Half Swipe"></a>Method 2: Half Swipe</h3><p>As the name suggests, rather than watching the entire story, you need to stop watching it halfway through. The only apparent disadvantage of this method is you won’t be able to see the whole story. The step that you will have to follow will be similar to watching a story normally. Follow these steps:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Facebook application and click on any of the stories.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> While viewing, put the finger on the story right before the story is about to end.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Quickly swipe right or left and make sure the story doesn’t end. This way, Facebook won’t register you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Block-Them"><a href="#Method-3-Block-Them" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Block Them"></a>Method 3: Block Them</h3><p>This is another method to stop appearing as one of the viewers. This method will let you view the whole story; however, since it involves blocking the user, they will be removed from your friend list completely. So, try it if only you are fine with removing that person from your friends’ list. Here’s how to follow this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook account and log in, and then <strong>c</strong>lick on the story that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once done, block the person. If you want, you can unblock them after 24 hours.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120861/26400?prodsku=Saturn" target="_top" id="2120861">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120861" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120861/26400?prodsku=Saturn"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously"><a href="#Method-4-Deactivate-your-Facebook-Account-to-View-Story-Anonymously" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously"></a>Method 4: Deactivate your Facebook Account to View Story Anonymously</h3><p>For the last resort, you can deactivate your account and reactivate it after a while so that your name doesn’t appear on the viewer’s list. Even though this is an extreme step to take, but it keeps you anonymous. So, here’s how you can do this method:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your Facebook account and log in and then click on the story or stories that you want to see.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three dots on the top right, then select the Settings and Privacy option, click on the Privacy Shortcuts option.</p><p> <strong>Step 3:</strong> You will see the Delete Your Account option.

If your account is public, you will also have the other viewer option, which will show you the number of unknown people who viewed your story. But unfortunately, it doesn’t show you who they are.</p><ol><li><strong>Can I see how many times someone views my Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Currently, Facebook doesn’t have the feature to show how many times someone has viewed your Facebook story. The only thing you can check is who viewed the story.</p><ol><li><strong>What Does “Other Viewers” Mean on Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>Other viewers option appears only on the public accounts. So, when you upload a story on your public profile, it becomes visible for everyone to see. But you can change it by limiting the viewer to friends only. But if there is an “other viewer” option available, it means that someone other than the people in your friend list has seen your story too.</p><ol><li><strong>How to tell if someone has seen my Facebook Story?</strong></li></ol><p>To know whether someone has seen your Facebook story or not, simply click on your story and tap on the viewer’s option. You will have a list of people who checked your story.</p><ol><li><strong>How can I save someone’s Facebook Story after viewing it?</strong></li></ol><p>If you want to save someone’s Facebook story, you can get the <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Story Saver for a Facebook extension <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It’s a Google Chrome extension. You need to download it and once it’s installed, just click on the story, and it will be saved and downloaded in the Download option.</p><ol><li><strong>Will people know if I viewed their Facebook story?</strong></li></ol><p>Yes, just like you can see who viewed your Facebook story, others can also check the same by clicking on the viewer option available on their story.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-five-expert-tools-for-extracting-fb-content/"><u>[New] Five Expert Tools for Extracting FB Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-simplified-steps-for-posting-tweets-on-facebook/"><u>[New] In 2024, Simplified Steps for Posting Tweets on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-screen-grab.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-blur-away-distractions-essential-tips-for-immaculate-google-meet-spaces/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Blur Away Distractions Essential Tips for Immaculate Google Meet Spaces</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-step-by-step-guide-to-record-online-video-calls/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Step-by-Step Guide to Record Online Video Calls</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/updated-narrative-basics-explanation/"><u>[Updated] Narrative Basics Explanation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-packing-list-film-your-excursions/"><u>[Updated] Packing List Film Your Excursions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-reviving-the-disappearing-video-icon-on-fb-watch-platform/"><u>2024 Approved Reviving the Disappearing Video Icon on FB Watch Platform</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-unmuting-your-social-network-fixing-half-volume-videos/"><u>2024 Approved Unmuting Your Social Network Fixing Half-Volume Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-identify-missing-or-malfunctioning-hardware-drivers-with-windows-device-manager-on-windows-11-and-10-and-7-by-drivereasy-guide/"><u>How to identify missing or malfunctioning hardware drivers with Windows Device Manager on Windows 11 & 10 & 7</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/transcribing-chats-efficient-techniques-for-fb-live-recordings-for-2024/"><u>Transcribing Chats Efficient Techniques for FB Live Recordings for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/ling-youtubes-behind-the-scenes-editor-space-for-2024/"><u>Unveiling YouTube's Behind-the-Scenes Editor Space for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Using third party tools you can gauge the tendency chart.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2115938/19272" target="_top" id="2115938">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2115938" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2115938/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Step-4-Locate-Follower-country"><a href="#Step-4-Locate-Follower-country" class="headerlink" title="Step 4: Locate Follower country"></a>Step 4: Locate Follower country</h3><p>For tracking fake followers on Facebook, you need to know their location. Knowing location also helps you in finding the origin of followers of an influencer who show interest in your product or brand. In case the influencer is from one country and their followers majorly are from another country or continent then they are fake or purchased. When the influencer’s location and post topic seem unusual, you should know that there are chances of fake followers. You can contact the influencer and request for screenshots of audience analytics to figure out if the followers are fake or not.</p><h3 id="Step-5-Use-third-party-tools"><a href="#Step-5-Use-third-party-tools" class="headerlink" title="Step 5: Use third party tools"></a>Step 5: Use third party tools</h3><p>You can try <a class="link"   href="https://phlanx.com/" >Phlanx <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for analyzing Facebook followers for influencers.

Once the 24 hours timeline is over, your Facebook story is removed automatically. However, you may want to delete your Facebook story before it reaches the end of its timeline for a reason.

Ford v Ferrari"                ></p><p>This video was among the most viral videos as it features a clip from the infamous 2019 Movie ‘Ford vs. Ferrari.’ It has amassed 8.5 million views and 92 thousand likes and reactions, plus 1.9k comments.</p><p>The Facebook video’s main highlight is how Ken Miles, one of the main characters, qualifies to rate for the major racing event ‘Le Mans.’</p><p>The vice president of Ford Motor Company, Leo Beebe, is shown arguing with Ken Miles, a hot-headed British racer and a struggling mechanic who helps Carroll Shelby build the Ford GT40 Mk for Henry Ford II.</p><p>As the prototype car is ready, Leo Beebe opts to send another racer to test it in its first racing event, ‘Daytona,’ instead of Ken Miles himself.</p><p>However, just at the right time, Henry Ford II appears for a test drive of the machine he has invested $9 million in, and Carroll Shelby takes him for a spin. Dumbfounded by the car’s potential, Henry Ford II allows Ken Miles to race Daytona on Shelby’s request overriding Leo Beebe’s order.</p><p>Towards the end of the clip, Ken Miles appears to be losing the Daytona event, but with a secret trick up their sleeves, Carrol Shelby clears Miles to push the car beyond the 7000 RPM tachometer red line.</p><p>Everyone is skeptical about pushing the car to its limits, but Ken Miles, knowing what he built, pushes the car in the last lap and, to everyone’s surprise, passes all the cars and wins the event. The end of the video shows his team shouting and cheering him up and a disappointed and fumed Leo Beebe.</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://fb.watch/a4y44xCDLr/" >The Ford GT… Ford v Ferrari <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-number-2-Asking-Superyacht-Owners-What-They-Do-For-a-Living"><a href="#Video-number-2-Asking-Superyacht-Owners-What-They-Do-For-a-Living" class="headerlink" title="Video number 2: Asking Superyacht Owners What They Do For a Living"></a>Video number 2: Asking Superyacht Owners What They Do For a Living</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-trending-videos-on-facebook-files-2.jpg"                      alt="Asking Superyacht Owners What They Do For a Living"                ></p><p>This video is uploaded on the Facebook page by ‘LADbible Australia’ and is titled ‘This lad asked superyacht owners what they do for a living.

The restaurant staff misbehaved with her and discriminated against the woman based on her disability.</p><p>They assume that the critic might get a bad impression if anything is out of order or unusual, and it may become the reason for their restaurant’s failure.</p><p>The staff insults her in many views including misbehaving, not taking the right order, providing her with the wrong food, and asking her to switch tables despite being pre-booked.</p><p>Towards the end, when the lady has had enough, she stands out of her wheelchair, and to everyone’s surprise, she is the food critic by the name of Brooke White, who imitated to be in a wheelchair and test the restaurant staff.</p><p>The manager, waiter, and owner are flabbergasted by the critic’s disguise and immediately start apologizing, but the damage is done! This viral video was a lesson for all of us not to discriminate against anyone based on their disabilities, looks, or any other thing and treat everyone equally with respect.</p><p>The link to the video is:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://fb.watch/a4AF37n3LJ/" >Disabled Woman Was Refused in Service at the Restaurant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123740/7443" target="_top" id="2123740">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123740" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123740/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Video-number-4-The-Final-Boss-OF-Riddles-Dad"><a href="#Video-number-4-The-Final-Boss-OF-Riddles-Dad" class="headerlink" title="Video number 4: The Final Boss OF Riddles: Dad"></a>Video number 4: The Final Boss OF Riddles: Dad</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-trending-videos-on-facebook-files-4.jpg"                      alt="When you get to the final boss of riddles: The Dad"                ></p><p>This video was uploaded on 1st June 2021 by the Facebook page named ‘LADbible Australia’ and has amassed a total of 65 million views, 185 thousand likes, and reacts, along with 9 thousand comments.</p><p>It features a daughter asking her dad riddles, and the dad is simply amazing at solving them.

The restaurant staff misbehaved with her and discriminated against the woman based on her disability.</p><p>They assume that the critic might get a bad impression if anything is out of order or unusual, and it may become the reason for their restaurant’s failure.</p><p>The staff insults her in many views including misbehaving, not taking the right order, providing her with the wrong food, and asking her to switch tables despite being pre-booked.</p><p>Towards the end, when the lady has had enough, she stands out of her wheelchair, and to everyone’s surprise, she is the food critic by the name of Brooke White, who imitated to be in a wheelchair and test the restaurant staff.</p><p>The manager, waiter, and owner are flabbergasted by the critic’s disguise and immediately start apologizing, but the damage is done! This viral video was a lesson for all of us not to discriminate against anyone based on their disabilities, looks, or any other thing and treat everyone equally with respect.</p><p>The link to the video is:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://fb.watch/a4AF37n3LJ/" >Disabled Woman Was Refused in Service at the Restaurant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-number-4-The-Final-Boss-OF-Riddles-Dad-1"><a href="#Video-number-4-The-Final-Boss-OF-Riddles-Dad-1" class="headerlink" title="Video number 4: The Final Boss OF Riddles: Dad"></a>Video number 4: The Final Boss OF Riddles: Dad</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-trending-videos-on-facebook-files-4.jpg"                      alt="When you get to the final boss of riddles: The Dad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982456">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982456">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982456.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982456%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982456/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This video was uploaded on 1st June 2021 by the Facebook page named ‘LADbible Australia’ and has amassed a total of 65 million views, 185 thousand likes, and reacts, along with 9 thousand comments.</p><p>It features a daughter asking her dad riddles, and the dad is simply amazing at solving them.

It is titled ‘Disabled Woman Was Refused in Service at the Restaurant.’</p><p>It was a viral video that trended on Facebook for quite some time as it featured a re-enactment of a social experiment.</p><p>The video is a short film that stars a lady in a wheelchair who dines in a restaurant. The restaurant staff misbehaved with her and discriminated against the woman based on her disability.</p><p>They assume that the critic might get a bad impression if anything is out of order or unusual, and it may become the reason for their restaurant’s failure.</p><p>The staff insults her in many views including misbehaving, not taking the right order, providing her with the wrong food, and asking her to switch tables despite being pre-booked.</p><p>Towards the end, when the lady has had enough, she stands out of her wheelchair, and to everyone’s surprise, she is the food critic by the name of Brooke White, who imitated to be in a wheelchair and test the restaurant staff.</p><p>The manager, waiter, and owner are flabbergasted by the critic’s disguise and immediately start apologizing, but the damage is done! This viral video was a lesson for all of us not to discriminate against anyone based on their disabilities, looks, or any other thing and treat everyone equally with respect.</p><p>The link to the video is:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://fb.watch/a4AF37n3LJ/" >Disabled Woman Was Refused in Service at the Restaurant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134490/18498" target="_top" id="2134490">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134490" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134490/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Video-number-4-The-Final-Boss-OF-Riddles-Dad-2"><a href="#Video-number-4-The-Final-Boss-OF-Riddles-Dad-2" class="headerlink" title="Video number 4: The Final Boss OF Riddles: Dad"></a>Video number 4: The Final Boss OF Riddles: Dad</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-trending-videos-on-facebook-files-4.jpg"                      alt="When you get to the final boss of riddles: The Dad"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/c/5597632/2123899/26106" target="_top" id="2123899">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26106-2123899" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://smilemakers.pxf.io/i/5597632/2123899/26106"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>This video was uploaded on 1st June 2021 by the Facebook page named ‘LADbible Australia’ and has amassed a total of 65 million views, 185 thousand likes, and reacts, along with 9 thousand comments.</p><p>It features a daughter asking her dad riddles, and the dad is simply amazing at solving them.

In such cases, Facebook shows the song name as well as the singer’s name so that we can know our fault.</p><p>Whenever you use the wrong music in your Facebook video, and it gets partially muted, then mostly we see a message on the screen saying ‘’Your video is partially muted because it may contain music that belongs to someone else.

Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don’t have the rights to use all of the content in it”.</p><p>If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the ‘Post Video’ button.

If you complain that <strong>your video is partially muted</strong> Facebook, then you must have added someone else’s music. In such cases, Facebook shows the song name as well as the singer’s name so that we can know our fault.</p><p>Whenever you use the wrong music in your Facebook video, and it gets partially muted, then mostly we see a message on the screen saying ‘’Your video is partially muted because it may contain music that belongs to someone else.

A warning message could be seen at this point, saying:</p><p>“Restore audio if you feel this is a mistake and you have the rights to use this content.

Video Gets Reported"></a>1. Video Gets Reported</h3><p>One factor that aids in your <strong>Facebook video partially muted</strong> is when your video is reported to Facebook in case it violates any copyright laws. You might hide and find a way to upload your content to Facebook, but if someone else reports your content to Facebook, then <strong>your video is partially muted.</strong></p><h3 id="2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music"><a href="#2-Facebook-Prevents-the-Use-of-Copyrighted-Music" class="headerlink" title="2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music"></a>2. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music</h3><p>Facebook has got some strict policies when it comes to copyrighted music. You cannot add any copyrighted music to even a small fragment of your video. Facebook exclusively prevents the rights of the artists who have created the music.</p><p>If you upload anything with copyrighted music, then either <strong>your video is partially muted on Facebook</strong>, or else the other options Facebook has is to remove the video.</p><h3 id="3-Someone-Else’s-Music"><a href="#3-Someone-Else’s-Music" class="headerlink" title="3. Someone Else’s Music"></a>3. Someone Else’s Music</h3><p>If you are using music that belongs to someone else, then Facebook is not going to tolerate that at all. If you complain that <strong>your video is partially muted</strong> Facebook, then you must have added someone else’s music. In such cases, Facebook shows the song name as well as the singer’s name so that we can know our fault.</p><p>Whenever you use the wrong music in your Facebook video, and it gets partially muted, then mostly we see a message on the screen saying ‘’Your video is partially muted because it may contain music that belongs to someone else. Learn More.”</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-1.jpg"                      alt="facebook video partially muted"                ></p><p>The issue of copyrighted music wasn’t resolved, and the situation to take down videos was getting worse. So, by the year 2018, Facebook made a few deals with the big music industries like Universal Music Group and Sony Music Publishing. These deals gave users better options to add music to their content and to make them more interesting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1265663">                    <video width="240" height="200" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4482-1265663">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1265663.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:150px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fmartinic.evyy.net%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1265663%2F4482'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1265663/4482"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-What-Can-I-Do-When-Facebook-Muted-My-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

The question here arises that what could be done in a situation where <strong>Facebook video partially muted?</strong></p><p>The coming section of this article will bring all the answers to you.

Warning Before Posting Video"></a>1. Warning Before Posting Video</h3><p>In some cases, Facebook gives you a warning before you post your video. The warning message is something like this:</p><p>“Your video was not posted because it may contain music, audio, or video that belongs to someone else. Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don’t have the rights to use all of the content in it”.</p><p>If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the ‘Post Video’ button. This is because you have the right to use the stock files in your videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134234/18498" target="_top" id="2134234">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134234" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134234/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="2-If-Video-is-Muted"><a href="#2-If-Video-is-Muted" class="headerlink" title="2.

We are going to talk about the solutions that could be adopted when Facebook mutes your videos.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123734/7443" target="_top" id="2123734">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123734" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123734/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Warning-Before-Posting-Video-1"><a href="#1-Warning-Before-Posting-Video-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don’t have the rights to use all of the content in it”.</p><p>If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the ‘Post Video’ button.

While circulated as a question, this virus operates over clicking the video link usually inserted across the message. Over clicking the link, a fake YouTube page or another significant look-alike platform opens up in a window that tricks the view of the people.</p><p>Most people believe in the originality of this fake platform and enter their credentials across it to give away their passwords to the hackers behind it. This imitation puts in a consistent threat of getting their remote server controlled by hackers. This malicious threat is all that puts your complete profile under an imminent threat.</p><p>What looks like an original Facebook login page is just a randomly generated URL that can be recognized in many ways. The sites utilize HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is one of the simplest techniques to assume the link is a fake page to get out your information. The scam, however, extends to something beyond just getting personal information out of the user.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2130530/26400" target="_top" id="2130530">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2130530" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2130530/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials-3"><a href="#What-Does-the-Virus-Do-After-Leading-Into-the-Account-Credentials-3" class="headerlink" title="What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?"></a>What Does the Virus Do After Leading Into the Account Credentials?</h3><p>This malicious software or viruses associated with the links are making money out of these potential scams.

Hashtags are used on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.</p><p> The same promotional post can go out on each site. It would have great performance as the hashtags you are using would be popular on all of those sites.</p><p> But it is important to use some caution with using the same posts for all your social accounts. For instance, posts that are image or video-centric are better for Instagram, while posting links is more useful on Twitter and Facebook.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135364/19272" target="_top" id="2135364">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135364" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135364/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="3-Promote-Special-Events"><a href="#3-Promote-Special-Events" class="headerlink" title="3. Promote Special Events"></a>3. Promote Special Events</h3><p> When there is a special promotion, event or landmark associated with a business, using a hashtag for that occasion can be very helpful. A business that is having a sale, for example, could use a hashtag such as #discounts to indicate that fact. Anyone who is searching for that hashtag would see the post!</p><p> Hashtags are also useful for contests. While you cannot have someone enter a contest through a hashtag because of Facebook rules, it is helpful in letting more people know about the contest.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings"><a href="#Part-3-Be-Careful-With-Hashtag-Privacy-Settings" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings"></a>Part 3: Be Careful With Hashtag Privacy Settings</h2><p> Facebook has privacy settings that can be enabled on any personal or business account. And those privacy settings will impact hashtag post visibility.</p><p> When the settings do not let anyone else but your followers see your posts, even posts with a hashtag are not visible to non-followers. It will be important to adjust those settings to ensure that you have a wider reach with your posts that include hashtags.</p><p> For instance, you could choose a privacy setting where only <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/help/134343280099148?helpref=uf_permalink" >followers can see the posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, or followers along with friends of followers. The second option gives you a little more reach, but still limits visibility.</p><p> When marketers are attempting to reach the widest possible audience, making posts public is the way to go. It will make non-hashtag posts public as well. But it ensures that any post with a hashtag has incredible reach.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> Hashtags have become a crucial element of the Facebook experience. Someone who is searching for a product or service in the area, reading about a popular topic, or hoping to gather information on a news story will use hashtags. Marketers can use hashtags to ensure that any promotional campaigns, influencer marketing strategies or general posts are reaching a wider audience.</p><p> So hashtags are so important to Facebook.
