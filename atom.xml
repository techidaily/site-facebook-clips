Such ads help you earn money but what you don’t know is that not everyone can place <strong>instream Facebook</strong> ads on their videos. Certain eligibility criteria should be met for doing this. You can check whether your video is eligible or not from Studio Creator.</p><p>The first thing that should be checked is that you are publishing the video from a Page and not a profile.

Secondly, to stay eligible and also to meet the criteria, you must meet ‘Partner Monetization Policies.’ Your Page must have at least 10,000 followers along with other eligibility criteria.

They can earn money from both live videos as well as on-demand videos. Facebook ads can either appear before the video, during or also, after the video. Facebook Auction System selects the ads that appear in the middle of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-instream-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="types of fb instream ads"                ></p><p>As we have mentioned, ads might appear before, during, or after the video. So hence, <strong>FB instream ads</strong> have various formats. Let us introduce them to you.</p><p><strong>Pre-Roll Ads</strong></p><p>Ads that are played before the video starts are known as Pre-Roll ads. People who seek out content actively are mostly shown these ads. The more you seek out content, the more you receive these ads.</p><p><strong>Mid-Roll Ads</strong></p><p>Ads that play during the video are referred to as Mid-Roll ads. If your video has natural breakpoints, then this ad format works best.</p><p><strong>Image Ads</strong></p><p>Some ads are displayed under the content. These ads are static and are known as Image Ads. These types of ads work best for videos that cannot adjust mid-roll ads.</p><p><strong>Post-Roll Ads</strong></p><p>Lastly, the ads that play at the end of the video are known as Post-Roll Ads. These ads are mostly shown to those viewers who have not received any pre-roll, mid-roll, or image ad.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Instream-Ads-for-Live"><a href="#Part-2-Instream-Ads-for-Live" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Instream Ads for Live"></a>Part 2. Instream Ads for Live</h2><p>It is a common practice that Facebook Pages do live streams where they answer your question or do live chat. What you don’t know is that you can place <strong>Facebook in-stream</strong> <strong>ads</strong> before or during your live stream. Before you start the live session, you can select if you want to show or not show any ads. If you don’t know how that’s done, then follow the steps shared below.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First of all, head over to ‘Live Producer’ and set your stream. Now, you can access the instream ads from the dashboard of Live Producer under the Monetization section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-instream-ads-2.jpg"                      alt="access live producer "                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Next, for accessing the default in-stream ad settings of your Page, you need to click on the expand icon. The icon will be visible within the widget.</p><p><strong>Step 3</strong>: Now, in Creator Studio, click on the ‘Monetization’ tab. There, select ‘Instream ads’ and hit the option of ‘Settings.’ You can toggle on the option so that default ads are included.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-instream-ads-3.jpg"                      alt="access the instream ads option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Lastly, you can go live and enjoy because the <strong>instream Facebook</strong> ad settings are complete.</p><p>Once your live stream is complete, you can save the video to your Page. While saving and publishing the video, you will have an option to either include the ads or not include them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-instream-ads-4.jpg"                      alt="add instream ads or not"                ></p><p>There is one important thing that you should know.

Video with a fresh and fascinatingly entertaining content becomes a potential viral video. Creating them in widely used language (such as English) would garner more popularity sans the cultural or geographical background of a person.</p><p>Shorter videos between 2 minutes effectively perform in comparison to longer versions. But, ensure that the gist of your message should be delivered within that time frame. Make the video so understandable and connecting, that words just add charm to it and not solely define it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-length.JPG"                      alt="facebook video short"                ></p><h3 id="4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically"><a href="#4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically" class="headerlink" title="4.

Is your live video interrupted on Facebook? You can get a ‘broadcast interrupted’ message when the Facebook servers don’t work promptly. You can also get this notification when you exceed your broadband bandwidth. It can happen because of a poor internet connection. Another common cause is a firewall that prevents the information from reaching the servers quickly enough.</p><p>This article explores the causes of why this might happen. You can also access the solutions to help you offset Facebook live video problems in the future. Let’s look at how to fix live video interruptions on Facebook.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?"></a>Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</h2><p>You might be wondering, ‘why does my live stream keep stopping?’. Well, we have a few possible reasons why your Facebook live stream keeps stopping. The basic reason could be that the broadcaster’s network connection might be down. It happens if the broadcaster’s connection is weak. If the network connectivity is poor, then that could be why Facebook live is interrupted.</p><p>Your PC and mobile devices (iOS and Android) share a single internet connection. Regardless of having many active connections, your devices will likely use only one. It’s typically WiFi, mobile data, or a wired connection. If your internet signal is weak or spotty, your device will lose packets. Packets are small amounts of data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-1.png"                      alt="error occurred when loading page facebook"                ></p><p>It can look like you’ve lost connection or graphics may fail to load, or the live feed can collapse. Especially if you’ve exhausted your data availability. One way to check if the problem is on your end is to run an internet speed test. This can indicate if this is due to network failure. This can cause your Facebook live video problems.</p><p>This decides that cause is not on your end. What remains is that it can be the fault of your internet service provider. It can be difficult to pin down as a layperson if this is the case. You can always use tools available online to check if your service provider is the issue or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-2.png"                      alt="can’t go live error on facebook"                ></p><p>There can be a few other reasons why Facebook live gets choppy or interrupted. It can also stem from your browser’s cache being full. You may have forgotten to disable your adblock. One more thing you can look into is the firewall in place. A firewall is located either on your personal computer or the network. Your firewall works by blocking the internet ports essential for communication. If your firewall blocks these portals during live streams, you can also experience blockages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-3.png"                      alt="adblockers interrupting facebook live stream"                ></p><p>So, now that we’ve highlighted some underlying causes that could prevent Facebook live videos from streaming. Let’s look at how we can resolve these issues in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?"></a>Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</h2><p>In this section, we’re going to address the problem of ‘why does Facebook live keep stopping?’ There are two ways to approach this. If you’re the streamer, then this method is for you.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos"><a href="#Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos"></a>Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos</h3><p>Are you experiencing some issues when going live from your page? These are the steps you need to take to resolve the issue.</p><p><strong>Look for Error Messages:</strong>  Once you initiate the broadcast, the events are logged. The simplest way to see what issues exist in your live stream is to check the ‘Event Log.’ This log will show if any errors exist, and it will pinpoint where. You can also use filters to show you warnings or alerts for your issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-4.png"                      alt="something went wrong error on facebook"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Use-this-Checklist"><a href="#Method-2-Use-this-Checklist" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use this Checklist"></a>Method 2: Use this Checklist</h3><p>If you’re a streamer, then this checklist can be essential to pinpoint the issue.</p><ol><li>You can use a web browser from your personal computer to ensure you go live from your computer.</li><li>It takes approximately ten seconds for your live stream to appear in the preview section. Wait the whole ten seconds to check if the stream has gone live or not.</li><li>Check if you have stable broadband. You can do this by using internet speed tests available online.</li><li>Remember to disable any adblocking software or browser plugins. They might have a hand in your stream not loading. It might also halt the video player from loading.</li><li>Check your firewall settings to make sure the internet ports are allowed to communicate. If your internet ports can’t communicate to the live stream, you will have issues streaming.</li><li>One simple fix is to check if your live stream URL is correct. If you’ve pasted an incorrect URL, it can result in live stream errors.</li><li>If your internet is not stable, go to Settings &gt; Live Producer &gt; check ‘End live video if the stream stops.’</li><li>Use a wired connection for extra security for your connection.</li><li>Keep your wireless connection only for the stream. Boot off colleagues, friends, and family by changing the password before the broadcast. You can also keep the line exclusively to broadcast your live streams.</li><li>Use ‘Publish as test broadcast’ to check if the live stream is in order.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-5.png"                      alt="publish as a test broadcast facebook"                ></p><p>Those were a run-through checklist of fixes you can use to help your video stream live without any issues. Let’s now turn our attention to issues stemming from the viewer’s side. If you’re a viewer checking in to see your favorite streamer. Then the next few fixes apply to you. You can look through the following solutions to find one that works for you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Poor-Connections"><a href="#Method-3-Poor-Connections" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Poor Connections"></a>Method 3. Poor Connections</h3><p>The two main points for failure tend to be the speed and stability of your internet connections. Here is what you can do to keep from asking ‘why is my Facebook live stream choppy?’</p><ol><li>Find a location with a strong WiFi connection. If you’re viewing on mobile, you can skip using mobile data and watch it on WiFi instead.</li><li>Check to see if your battery level is too low to view the stream or not. If so, charge your phone.</li><li>This step might be a bit extreme, but if you’re on mobile. You can block incoming calls. This will prevent interruptions of the stream.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-6.png"                      alt="poor connection on facebook"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915865/19272" target="_top" id="1915865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915865/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache"><a href="#Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Clear Browser Cache"></a>Method 4: Clear Browser Cache</h3><p>Let’s see how we can clear the browser cache to enhance streaming. These are the steps you need to take to clear the browser cache.</p><p><strong>Google Chrome:</strong></p><ol><li>Open chrome. Look for three vertical dots on the right-hand side of the browser. Click on that.</li><li>Select ‘More tools’</li><li>Tap on ‘Clear browsing data’ or press Ctrl+Shift+Del keys simultaneously.</li><li>Choose the time range you want the browser history cleared. Select ‘All time’ for a full wipe.</li><li>Click on ‘Cached images and files’ along with other options.</li><li>Click ‘Clear data.’</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-7.png"                      alt="clear browsing data on google chrome"                ></p><h3 id="Method-5-Disable-Adblock"><a href="#Method-5-Disable-Adblock" class="headerlink" title="Method 5: Disable Adblock"></a>Method 5: Disable Adblock</h3><p>One way to prevent your live streams from getting disrupted is to disable your Adblock. There are options within the browser extension that you can use. There is also a carte-blanche option. This works for all ad-blockers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on ‘Manage Add-ons’</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select ‘Toolbars and Extensions’</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Right-click your ad-block and tap on the ‘Disable’ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-8.png"                      alt="disable extension to stop live stream interruptions"                ></p><p>Those were the steps you need to take to fix any Facebook live video problems.

Is your live video interrupted on Facebook? You can get a ‘broadcast interrupted’ message when the Facebook servers don’t work promptly. You can also get this notification when you exceed your broadband bandwidth. It can happen because of a poor internet connection. Another common cause is a firewall that prevents the information from reaching the servers quickly enough.</p><p>This article explores the causes of why this might happen. You can also access the solutions to help you offset Facebook live video problems in the future. Let’s look at how to fix live video interruptions on Facebook.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping-3"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Does-Facebook-Live-Keep-Stopping-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?"></a>Part 1. Why Does Facebook Live Keep Stopping?</h2><p>You might be wondering, ‘why does my live stream keep stopping?’. Well, we have a few possible reasons why your Facebook live stream keeps stopping. The basic reason could be that the broadcaster’s network connection might be down. It happens if the broadcaster’s connection is weak. If the network connectivity is poor, then that could be why Facebook live is interrupted.</p><p>Your PC and mobile devices (iOS and Android) share a single internet connection. Regardless of having many active connections, your devices will likely use only one. It’s typically WiFi, mobile data, or a wired connection. If your internet signal is weak or spotty, your device will lose packets. Packets are small amounts of data.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-1.png"                      alt="error occurred when loading page facebook"                ></p><p>It can look like you’ve lost connection or graphics may fail to load, or the live feed can collapse. Especially if you’ve exhausted your data availability. One way to check if the problem is on your end is to run an internet speed test. This can indicate if this is due to network failure. This can cause your Facebook live video problems.</p><p>This decides that cause is not on your end. What remains is that it can be the fault of your internet service provider. It can be difficult to pin down as a layperson if this is the case. You can always use tools available online to check if your service provider is the issue or not.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-2.png"                      alt="can’t go live error on facebook"                ></p><p>There can be a few other reasons why Facebook live gets choppy or interrupted. It can also stem from your browser’s cache being full. You may have forgotten to disable your adblock. One more thing you can look into is the firewall in place. A firewall is located either on your personal computer or the network. Your firewall works by blocking the internet ports essential for communication. If your firewall blocks these portals during live streams, you can also experience blockages.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-3.png"                      alt="adblockers interrupting facebook live stream"                ></p><p>So, now that we’ve highlighted some underlying causes that could prevent Facebook live videos from streaming. Let’s look at how we can resolve these issues in the next section.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Solve-Facebook-Live-Stream-Keeps-Stopping-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?"></a>Part 2. How to Solve Facebook Live Stream Keeps Stopping?</h2><p>In this section, we’re going to address the problem of ‘why does Facebook live keep stopping?’ There are two ways to approach this. If you’re the streamer, then this method is for you.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos-3"><a href="#Method-1-Troubleshoot-Live-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos"></a>Method 1: Troubleshoot Live Videos</h3><p>Are you experiencing some issues when going live from your page? These are the steps you need to take to resolve the issue.</p><p><strong>Look for Error Messages:</strong>  Once you initiate the broadcast, the events are logged. The simplest way to see what issues exist in your live stream is to check the ‘Event Log.’ This log will show if any errors exist, and it will pinpoint where. You can also use filters to show you warnings or alerts for your issues.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-4.png"                      alt="something went wrong error on facebook"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1531882">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1531882">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1531882.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1531882%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1531882/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://review-au.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135316/14409" target="_top" id="2135316">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/14409-2135316" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://review-au.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135316/14409"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Method-2-Use-this-Checklist-3"><a href="#Method-2-Use-this-Checklist-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Use this Checklist"></a>Method 2: Use this Checklist</h3><p>If you’re a streamer, then this checklist can be essential to pinpoint the issue.</p><ol><li>You can use a web browser from your personal computer to ensure you go live from your computer.</li><li>It takes approximately ten seconds for your live stream to appear in the preview section. Wait the whole ten seconds to check if the stream has gone live or not.</li><li>Check if you have stable broadband. You can do this by using internet speed tests available online.</li><li>Remember to disable any adblocking software or browser plugins. They might have a hand in your stream not loading. It might also halt the video player from loading.</li><li>Check your firewall settings to make sure the internet ports are allowed to communicate. If your internet ports can’t communicate to the live stream, you will have issues streaming.</li><li>One simple fix is to check if your live stream URL is correct. If you’ve pasted an incorrect URL, it can result in live stream errors.</li><li>If your internet is not stable, go to Settings &gt; Live Producer &gt; check ‘End live video if the stream stops.’</li><li>Use a wired connection for extra security for your connection.</li><li>Keep your wireless connection only for the stream. Boot off colleagues, friends, and family by changing the password before the broadcast. You can also keep the line exclusively to broadcast your live streams.</li><li>Use ‘Publish as test broadcast’ to check if the live stream is in order.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-5.png"                      alt="publish as a test broadcast facebook"                ></p><p>Those were a run-through checklist of fixes you can use to help your video stream live without any issues. Let’s now turn our attention to issues stemming from the viewer’s side. If you’re a viewer checking in to see your favorite streamer. Then the next few fixes apply to you. You can look through the following solutions to find one that works for you.</p><h3 id="Method-3-Poor-Connections-3"><a href="#Method-3-Poor-Connections-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 3. Poor Connections"></a>Method 3. Poor Connections</h3><p>The two main points for failure tend to be the speed and stability of your internet connections. Here is what you can do to keep from asking ‘why is my Facebook live stream choppy?’</p><ol><li>Find a location with a strong WiFi connection. If you’re viewing on mobile, you can skip using mobile data and watch it on WiFi instead.</li><li>Check to see if your battery level is too low to view the stream or not. If so, charge your phone.</li><li>This step might be a bit extreme, but if you’re on mobile. You can block incoming calls. This will prevent interruptions of the stream.</li></ol><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-6.png"                      alt="poor connection on facebook"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache-3"><a href="#Method-4-Clear-Browser-Cache-3" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Clear Browser Cache"></a>Method 4: Clear Browser Cache</h3><p>Let’s see how we can clear the browser cache to enhance streaming.

Click on that.</li><li>Select ‘More tools’</li><li>Tap on ‘Clear browsing data’ or press Ctrl+Shift+Del keys simultaneously.</li><li>Choose the time range you want the browser history cleared.

This works for all ad-blockers.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Settings</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on ‘Manage Add-ons’</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select ‘Toolbars and Extensions’</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Right-click your ad-block and tap on the ‘Disable’ button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-video-problems-8.png"                      alt="disable extension to stop live stream interruptions"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068432/7443" target="_top" id="2068432">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068432" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068432/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Those were the steps you need to take to fix any Facebook live video problems.

They can earn money from both live videos as well as on-demand videos. Facebook ads can either appear before the video, during or also, after the video. Facebook Auction System selects the ads that appear in the middle of the video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-instream-ads-1.jpg"                      alt="types of fb instream ads"                ></p><p>As we have mentioned, ads might appear before, during, or after the video. So hence, <strong>FB instream ads</strong> have various formats. Let us introduce them to you.</p><p><strong>Pre-Roll Ads</strong></p><p>Ads that are played before the video starts are known as Pre-Roll ads. People who seek out content actively are mostly shown these ads. The more you seek out content, the more you receive these ads.</p><p><strong>Mid-Roll Ads</strong></p><p>Ads that play during the video are referred to as Mid-Roll ads. If your video has natural breakpoints, then this ad format works best.</p><p><strong>Image Ads</strong></p><p>Some ads are displayed under the content. These ads are static and are known as Image Ads. These types of ads work best for videos that cannot adjust mid-roll ads.</p><p><strong>Post-Roll Ads</strong></p><p>Lastly, the ads that play at the end of the video are known as Post-Roll Ads. These ads are mostly shown to those viewers who have not received any pre-roll, mid-roll, or image ad.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Instream-Ads-for-Live"><a href="#Part-2-Instream-Ads-for-Live" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Instream Ads for Live"></a>Part 2. Instream Ads for Live</h2><p>It is a common practice that Facebook Pages do live streams where they answer your question or do live chat. What you don’t know is that you can place <strong>Facebook in-stream</strong> <strong>ads</strong> before or during your live stream. Before you start the live session, you can select if you want to show or not show any ads. If you don’t know how that’s done, then follow the steps shared below.</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: First of all, head over to ‘Live Producer’ and set your stream. Now, you can access the instream ads from the dashboard of Live Producer under the Monetization section.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-instream-ads-2.jpg"                      alt="access live producer "                ></p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Next, for accessing the default in-stream ad settings of your Page, you need to click on the expand icon.

There, select ‘Instream ads’ and hit the option of ‘Settings.’ You can toggle on the option so that default ads are included.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-instream-ads-3.jpg"                      alt="access the instream ads option"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4</strong>: Lastly, you can go live and enjoy because the <strong>instream Facebook</strong> ad settings are complete.</p><p>Once your live stream is complete, you can save the video to your Page. While saving and publishing the video, you will have an option to either include the ads or not include them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/facebook-instream-ads-4.jpg"                      alt="add instream ads or not"                ></p><p>There is one important thing that you should know.

To edit the Look Back video, simply hit the “Edit” button on the top right corner of the Look Back page.
