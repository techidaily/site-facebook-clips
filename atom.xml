Keeping this fact in mind, Facebook is focusing more on video content to be adapted within their algorithm and enabling features like auto-play. In this post, we will tell you how to do Facebook video marketing.</p><h2 id="10-tips-for-Facebook-video-marketing"><a href="#10-tips-for-Facebook-video-marketing" class="headerlink" title="10 tips for Facebook video marketing"></a>10 tips for Facebook video marketing</h2><h3 id="1-Facebook-Live-video-is-a-trend"><a href="#1-Facebook-Live-video-is-a-trend" class="headerlink" title="1. Facebook Live video is a trend"></a>1. Facebook Live video is a trend</h3><p>Since last year, the average time for consuming Facebook Live videos has increased four-fold. Reports from Facebook’s research reveal that video content is consumed five times more than static content by the users.</p><p>Facebook Live has taken things to a new level. As soon as you go live on Facebook, your friends and followers&#x2F;subscribers get notifications automatically.</p><p>Facebook video marketing seems great where you can live interact with your consumers about your products&#x2F;services or a promotional event. You get feedbacks, suggestions for improvements, or outright praise from them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-live-iphone.JPG"                      alt="facebook live video"                ></p><h3 id="2-Upload-Videos-Directly-to-Facebook-rather-than-YouTube"><a href="#2-Upload-Videos-Directly-to-Facebook-rather-than-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="2. Upload Videos Directly to Facebook rather than YouTube"></a>2. Upload Videos Directly to Facebook rather than YouTube</h3><p>Though videos on YouTube usually get views but uploading directly on to Facebook would bring more viewership for your social media video.</p><p>Videos on Facebook perform better than other platforms for video sharing denotes a popular source. Apart from that compared to photo and other graphic posts, videos receive a whopping 135% higher organic search on Facebook.</p><p>Facebook marketing videos are becoming the strongest confidants of business owners nowadays due to these facts.</p><p>The default auto-play feature even makes things lot better, as people stop by to watch at least 5-6 seconds of the video while scrolling down and get hooked to it, without even searching for it.</p><p>The video view counter helps you estimate the way your viral video fared. You can understand users’ behavior to understand their needs and what can you do to bring them to you again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-video-to-facebook.JPG"                      alt="upload video to facebook"                ></p><h3 id="3-Keep-your-Facebook-video-short"><a href="#3-Keep-your-Facebook-video-short" class="headerlink" title="3. Keep your Facebook video short"></a>3. Keep your Facebook video short</h3><p>Like text content, your Facebook Marketing video should also be crisp and short. Video with a fresh and fascinatingly entertaining content becomes a potential viral video. Creating them in widely used language (such as English) would garner more popularity sans the cultural or geographical background of a person.</p><p>Shorter videos between 2 minutes effectively perform in comparison to longer versions. But, ensure that the gist of your message should be delivered within that time frame. Make the video so understandable and connecting, that words just add charm to it and not solely define it.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-length.JPG"                      alt="facebook video short"                ></p><h3 id="4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically"><a href="#4-Shoot-Facebook-video-vertically" class="headerlink" title="4. Shoot Facebook video vertically"></a>4. Shoot Facebook video vertically</h3><p>A majority of Facebook users watch videos on their mobile phone or tablets. So shooting your social media video in vertical mode is pleasing to the eyes, while viewing it on a mobile. Portrait (vertically-aligned) videos have a better hit rate compared to horizontal shots. Keeping that in mind, make sure to create your new videos in a mobile friendly manner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video-vertical.JPG"                      alt="facebook vidoe vertical"                ></p><h3 id="5-Feature-a-Video-on-Facebook-Page"><a href="#5-Feature-a-Video-on-Facebook-Page" class="headerlink" title="5. Feature a Video on Facebook Page"></a>5. Feature a Video on Facebook Page</h3><p>Just like featured photos on the about section of your Facebook page, you can add your Facebook marketing video as a featured video. When people love your video they keep on sharing it to their near and dear ones, be it about anything.</p><p>It will make your video get popular and go viral as well in case it gets shared fast in a large number. Ensure that the video has a prominent thumbnail on your about page.</p><p>You can use it to promote an event, launch a product or service, or a teaser about some upcoming surprises. The clearer it gets on your page, the more clicks you will get from the audience.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/feature-video-facebook.JPG"                      alt="feature video facebook"                ></p><h3 id="6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail"><a href="#6-Carefully-choose-thumbnail" class="headerlink" title="6. Carefully choose thumbnail"></a>6. Carefully choose thumbnail</h3><p>Well! We have just said about the thumbnail on your Facebook video. The social media video you upload on Facebook will garner more viewership with a suitable and attractive thumbnail.</p><p>When there is a weak internet connection, the videos on Facebook might not auto-play; they would display a static image there. Don’t exceed the 90 characters Ad copy limit for the thumbnail, in case your video has text on it. Try to keep it as less as you can to adhere to Facebook’s 20% text policy.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-thumbnail.JPG"                      alt="facebook thumbnail"                ></p><h3 id="7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos"><a href="#7-Leverage-Facebook-360-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Leverage Facebook 360 Videos"></a>7. Leverage Facebook 360 Videos</h3><p>Facebook introduced 360 videos are a rage among the users. Keeping virtual reality in mind, Facebook launched this feature to improve communication and social interaction.</p><p>With a social media video shot with Facebook 360-degree feature, your viewers will connect more with your story and the experience you are sharing. For shooting an event and taking panoramic views 360-videos serve the best result.</p><p>These videos can be rotated, paned, and can be viewed from any angle they desire. They are loved 40 percent more than the traditional videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-360-video.JPG"                      alt="facebook 360 video"                ></p><h3 id="8-Mobile-friendly"><a href="#8-Mobile-friendly" class="headerlink" title="8. Mobile friendly"></a>8. Mobile friendly</h3><p>Being the perfect partner to kill time, while waiting for someone, travelling alone, or in the queue in a supermarket, mobile phones certainly have more attention than other gadgets.</p><p>So, Facebook marketing videos need to cash on this aspect. These videos need to be mobile-friendly, means they have to be short and aligned to fit any mobile screen size without pixellating. Adverts that scored high for mobiles have the following aspects –</p><ul><li>Easy to understandable message, even without any audio.</li><li>Most part of the video concentrates on the product or service.</li><li>The visuals identify the brand clearly</li><li>Voiceover supports the visuals.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mobile-users.JPG"                      alt="mobile friendly"                ></p><h3 id="9-Posting-time-is-important"><a href="#9-Posting-time-is-important" class="headerlink" title="9. Posting time is important"></a>9. Posting time is important</h3><p>Knowing the right time to post your social media video on Facebook or any other social media platform is vital.</p><p>People from diverse backgrounds or field of work consume different video content. You might have heard that Wednesdays are great for business related videos.</p><p>There are tools to study the statistics and analyze the most favorable time for posting your Facebook marketing video. You can use them to determine what’s your time to post and get more viewership.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="facebook posting time"                ></p><h3 id="10-Add-call-to-action"><a href="#10-Add-call-to-action" class="headerlink" title="10.

You can add a link using goo.gl or bit.ly to cut-short the link and guide them for more information about your services.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="facebook call to action"                ></p><h3 id="11-Choose-a-suitable-video-creator"><a href="#11-Choose-a-suitable-video-creator" class="headerlink" title="11.

Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?"></a>Part 1. Choose Vertical Video or Horizontal Video for Facebook?</h2><p>Initially, Facebook had a platform that supported horizontal videos. Facebook displayed the vertical videos in squares, which led to a cropped video display. Users had to click on the video in order to watch it.</p><p>Snapchat pioneered the concept of vertical videos. Eventually, the rest of the social media apps followed suit, especially after introducing the Story feature.</p><p>Back in 2015, after analyzing the data and seeing that more people engage with vertical videos, Facebook updated the app such that vertical videos fit well in the News Feed. This not only worked out well for the users but also advertisers and publishers.</p><p>However, you may be wondering why Facebook didn’t switch completely to vertical videos like Snapchat. Well, this is because horizontal videos have their benefits as well. So, let’s look at different situations in which vertical or horizontal videos come in handy.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Horizontal-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Horizontal Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason why horizontal videos are in for the running is because our eyes have a horizontal alignment. So naturally, the horizontal view is more appealing for us.</p><p>The horizontal frame works best if you record things of daily life, such as making a video of multiple people or videos with different dynamics and motion.</p><p>Furthermore, you should go for horizontal videos if you plan on watching them on TVs or monitors as they have a horizontal orientation.</p><p>So, if you want to share a video of your group of friends on Facebook, make a horizontal video. Since Facebook did not completely shift to vertical videos, horizontal videos still work without ruining the outlook of your Feed.</p><h3 id="When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3"><a href="#When-to-Make-a-Vertical-Facebook-Video-3" class="headerlink" title="When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?"></a>When to Make a Vertical Facebook Video?</h3><p>The reason that vertical videos have become so popular is because of the shape of our smartphones. Since our smartphones have a vertical orientation, thus vertical videos are more feasible. This is because users hold their phones upright 94% of the time.</p><p>So, in order to engage the maximum audience, it is best to upload a vertical Facebook video. Since Facebook supports vertical videos, it becomes super easy to attract users’ attention.</p><p>Moreover, an analysis of the stats shows that vertical videos give you more value for your money than horizontal videos. In addition to this, a study also found that the completion rates of vertical videos were 4% higher than horizontal videos.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-2-Size-Aspect-Ratio-for-Facebook-Vertical-or-Horizontal-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos"></a>Part 2. Size Aspect Ratio for Facebook Vertical or Horizontal Videos</h2><p>When talking about the orientation of a video, an important concept that one must know is the Size Aspect Ratio.</p><p>In simple words, the size aspect ratio describes an image or video’s shape. It is written as a formula of width to height. For example, a square has a 1:1 size aspect ratio.</p><p>So, while making a Facebook video or during the post-production editing phase, you can adjust the size aspect ratio as per your requirement.</p><p>If you want to upload a vertical video on Facebook, then 9:16 is the perfect aspect ratio. Due to the upright positions of our phones, the 9:16 ratio works ideally for all the users.</p><p>However, if you want to upload a horizontal video on Facebook, you can use a 16:9 or a 1:1 aspect ratio.</p><p>Other aspect ratios that Facebook supports are given below in the image.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/is-facebook-videos-vertical-or-horizontal-2.jpg"                      alt="Supported Aspect Ratios for Facebook Ads"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3"><a href="#Part-3-Bonus-Tip-How-to-Make-Horizontal-or-Vertical-Video-Using-Wondershare-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3.

The basic meaning is that Facebook cares more about user spending quality on Facebook, rather than just focus on time. Traditionally, time spent is a key factor to measure Facebook’s growth, which results in increasing users’ spending time with all efforts. Now, things are changed. Facebook algorithm decides sharing and commenting are the symbols of meaningful interactions, meaning that Facebook wants you interact with friends. Randomly click likes on a photo, article or video are no longer positive signal to algorithm.</p><p>There <a class="link"   href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/new-facebook-algorithm-26-friends/" >once comes a rumor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook will only show 26 friends in feed, which is false. In fact, Facebook algorithm is broken down into four components. There is <strong>inventory</strong>, <strong>signals</strong>, <strong>predictions</strong> and the <strong>overall score</strong>. Signals are the considerations about content. And it is signals that marketers and businesses must focus on when they are promoting content through the Facebook news feed.</p><p>Signals include the average time spent on content, when it’s posted, the type of story, how many comments or likes it gets, and how often it is shared on the news feed or through Messenger.</p><p>The idea is that Facebook will promote content that gets more engagement, because those are the posts likely to come from family and friends. It is up to marketers to ensure their content is similarly personal and conversation-worthy!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: if you want to get a higher ranking in Facebook feed, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating square videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an important method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors"><a href="#Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors"></a>Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors</h2><p>When it comes to how content is ordered and presented on the Facebook news feed, there are four factors that go into the process. These ranking factors include comments, sharing, reactions and engagement. We explore each factor in depth below:</p><h3 id="1-Comments"><a href="#1-Comments" class="headerlink" title="1. Comments"></a>1. Comments</h3><p>When people or businesses make posts that no one reacts to - those posts are going to be shown a lot less in a person’s feed. Pages that promote conversation and get a lot of engagement will see a significant rise.</p><p>Brands must work on content that is getting people to comment and then converse with each other through the comment chain. It can be a focus on timely and relevant topics, which will get people talking immediately!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="facebook algorithm change comment 2019"                ></p><h3 id="2-Sharing"><a href="#2-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="2. Sharing"></a>2. Sharing</h3><p>Did you know that when <a class="link"   href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/facebook-messenger-link-urls-security/" >a link is shared on Messenger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Facebook users, it has an impact on how that post appears on the feed? Facebook cares about the interactions that people have through the content posted on the site. And that means a focus on content that is shared through Messenger.</p><p>Say a company makes a post that many followers enjoy. They like and&#x2F;or comment on the post. But they also copy the link and share it with friends through Messenger, instead of sharing it publicly on their feed.</p><p>Such shares are just as important as the public sharing. Many companies would focus on the public aspect with previous content. But now they can focus on getting people to share articles through the private chats on Messenger.</p><h3 id="3-Reactions"><a href="#3-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="3. Reactions"></a>3. Reactions</h3><p>People having a reaction to your content is increasingly important. When someone reacts to the comment through the available emojis, the post will be higher up in many followers’ feeds.</p><p>What also matters is the type of reaction they are having. It is said that when someone clicks on the love icon, it has a slightly better impact through the algorithm as compared to the like icon.</p><p>Facebook wants to see people having active and unique reactions to the post. Even the Wow, Sad, Angry and Haha icons have a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/resources/facebook-reactions" >more positive result as compared to the simple likes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-algorithm-change-reaction.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change Reactions"                ></p><h3 id="4-Engagement"><a href="#4-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="4. Engagement"></a>4. Engagement</h3><p>Facebook is going one step further when it comes to the engagement triggers on the algorithm. In the past, having the post shared by different users was enough to see it get a positive bump in the algorithm.</p><p>While those shares are still helpful, the impact is a bit less. What is really needed is a reaction on the shares of your followers.</p><p>Say your company makes a post and it is shared by 50 people. If there are many reactions to the followers of those 50 people when they shared your post, the original post will see a significant bump through the algorithm.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers"><a href="#Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers"></a>Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers</h2><p>The Facebook algorithm changes mean that it will be more challenging to reach people with posts that are made by businesses.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together" >Companies will need a very engaged audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if they want to gain traction on the feed through organic means. And that means posts that are shared, commented on, reacted to and more popular with the Facebook audience. Some pages will start posting something irrelevant with their business. But it is always important to build powerful content like Facebook says.</p><h2 id="Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm"><a href="#Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm"></a>Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm</h2><h3 id="1-Pay-attention-to-video"><a href="#1-Pay-attention-to-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Pay attention to video"></a>1. Pay attention to video</h3><p>Videos tend to attract engagement naturally if the video is good enough. However, have you ever considered live video? Facebook official said live video gets 6 times interactions than regular videos. It is true. In this Facebook algorithm change, <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-live-why-live-video-matters-for-marketers/" >live video matters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. More and more business owners try the new field - live video and they did pretty good. If you haven’t invest live video, now you should start looking for this new method to boost comments and shares.</p><p>Just like Facebook did in May 2. It showed Mark’s opening keynote on Facebook’s latest technology and innovation. Now, this live video has gained more than 1 thousand comments and shares. If you want to make Facebook videos, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It includes various titles&#x2F;text templates, visual effects and audio to make your marketing video perfect.</p><h3 id="2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities"><a href="#2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Engagement Opportunities"></a>2. Create Engagement Opportunities</h3><p>When people have more conversations on your posts, it means those posts are going to be higher up on the feed. Facebook cares about the interactions people are having with content, as they want them to spend more time on the platform.</p><p>Companies often use Facebook to put out basic news stories about the company, new products or discounts. While these posts are interesting, they are not exactly conversation starters. It will be up to businesses to ensure they are creating content that can help people have more meaningful conversations on the platform.</p><p>Sharing news stories that are related to the industry is one way to do this. A company does not always have to promote its own business through Facebook posts. Sharing opinions on changes in an industry that your followers care about is a good way to boost engagement levels, so making engagement opportunities is a great method to rely to Facebook algorithm change.</p><h3 id="3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups"><a href="#3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups" class="headerlink" title="3. Leverage Facebook Groups"></a>3. Leverage Facebook Groups</h3><p>Did you know that around <a class="link"   href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/27/facebook-groups-reaches-1-billion-users/79414710/" >1 billion people use Facebook Groups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? And around 100 million people say that when they are on Facebook, they are primarily using Groups to interact with other people and content.</p><p>Groups are the perfect way to build a community that is active and interested in specific topics. If a business can create groups that are targeting a community, niche or a segment of the market, it will help them boost engagement levels. Posts that are shared within those groups will see a lot of engagement, as they are filled with users who care about the content.</p><p>The impact will not only be felt in rising engagement within those groups, but in the way those posts are ranked in the general feed as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-groups.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads"></a>4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads</h3><p>The changes that Facebook has made to its algorithm were done with the company’s future in mind. Facebook wants to make more money and fuel growth. They do not want a user base that is rarely checking the platform or interacting with content.</p><p>The best advice that we can give to marketers and business owners is to ignore Facebook ads. The company has made changes so that you will turn to ads and simply pay to get your posts to the top of the feed.</p><p>But that does not have to be the case. You can completely ignore ads and focus on the organic efforts that we have mentioned above. Those will get you the higher levels of engagement that you need to remain relevant with the new algorithm. But you can still <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make ads by Facebook video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-ads.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="5-Stick-to-strong-content"><a href="#5-Stick-to-strong-content" class="headerlink" title="5. Stick to strong content"></a>5. Stick to strong content</h3><p>It is understandable for companies to feel as though a scary change has taken place on Facebook. The way that posts are prioritized in the feed is different to what it was before. Facebook claims it is all about getting family and friend posts closer to the top of the feed.</p><p>But like any algorithm change, marketers can react to ensure the content they are promoting is being seen by as many people as possible. <a class="link"   href="https://www.naturettl.com/upload-photos-facebook-best-quality-possible/" >Improving engagement and promoting conversation-worthy content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can help make that happen.</p><h3 id="6-Try-Facebook-influencer"><a href="#6-Try-Facebook-influencer" class="headerlink" title="6. Try Facebook influencer"></a>6. Try Facebook influencer</h3><p>Have you experienced posting a image without any engagement, even likes? If it happens, you should change your posting strategy. Today, Facebook influencer is showing powerful influencing ability. You should look for an influencer who has the same audience you want and are willing to interact with your brand. However, you should be aware of some influencers might have fake fans to get likes. As in this new Facebook algorithm change, likes are not the most essential factor, so you need to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >distinguish the fake fans and real fans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/algorithm-change-on-facebook-influencer.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change influencer"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this guide will help any business or marketer that is looking to use Facebook for promotional purposes in 2024.

It had brought turbulence in the social media world back in 2004 which were embraced by everybody and it is carrying that charm until now! It is a social networking company registered under the name of ‘Facebook, Inc’ which allows its users to communicate with other people. These other people are also defined by users and can be their family, friends, coworkers or potential friends! Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook created this boon of social media in 2004 while he was enrolled at Harvard University with a vision of designing a media platform for college students. But nobody would have imagined its progress graph! By 2006 anyone over the age of 13 with a valid email address could join Facebook. So this social networking website which was supposed to allow users to create profile, share moments through uploading photos and videos and assisted in staying in touch with family and friends for a long time, transformed into one of the much sought after platforms with more than 1 billion users worldwide.</p><p> Facebook is available in 37 different languages which truly reflect its respect towards diversity and it also supports various translation applications if you want to improve existing translation. Being the largest social media network was probably not enough for Facebook and hence the three key public features of Facebook which it has launched are classified as follows:</p><p><strong>Marketplace:</strong> It allows you to discover, buy and sell items in your community. You can post and respond to all sorts of ads of your region.</p><p><strong>Groups:</strong> It allows members to coordinate with near and far friends having common interests. The definition of common interests is open ended, it can be a bachelor party, concert bucket list or project updates, Facebook group lets you communicate in searchable place.</p><p><strong>Events:</strong> These encourage boosting engagement, get people talking, and provide helpful information and links for an upcoming event and ultimately planning and tracking who plans to attend. 650+ million users make use of Facebook Events and 100 million on an average every day to publicize the event!</p><h2 id="Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know"><a href="#Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="Common Facebook Terms which you should know"></a>Common Facebook Terms which you should know</h2><p> If you haven’t joined Facebook until now and feel left out in the group of your friends when they discuss about liking and reacting to a post, updating status, hashtags and tagging then don’t worry! There are lots of terms and phrases which can be termed as ‘Language of Facebook’. These words were in dictionary earlier also but Facebook reinvented their purpose! Warning: They might seem confusing at first but once you enter this world, then these will become your prime words!</p><p><strong>Status Update:</strong> These are text based posts that can describe your mood, thoughts or anything which you want to share with your Facebook friends.</p><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> This is like a page dedicated to you (As good as your profile). You can share information including your pictures, basic information like your favorite books, entertainment shows, celebrity etc.</p><p><strong>News Feed:</strong> You can term it as combination of status and timeline of your friends. News Feed shows you updates from your friends and recent posts from the Facebook pages that you follow. This is where you spend your most of the time!</p><p><strong>Like:</strong> If you enjoyed and want to reach on the profiles of your friends then you choose to Like or Dislike the post.</p><p><strong>Tag:</strong> It is like marking your friends who hold relevance to the pictures or status that you are uploading on your timeline. These then appears on the timeline of your friends and in newsfeed of other friends.</p><p><strong>Notification:</strong> It is like an update from Facebook of the events and occasions where someone has interacted with you. It might be through reacting on what you shared or by posting something on your wall etc.</p><h2 id="Exploring-Facebook"><a href="#Exploring-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Exploring Facebook"></a>Exploring Facebook</h2><p> Facebook is user friendly and once you create your account, you will feel like exploring all its options and becoming familiar with its adorable features. Here is a quick guide to Homepage and timeline:</p><h4 id="The-homepage"><a href="#The-homepage" class="headerlink" title="The homepage"></a>The homepage</h4><p> As soon as sign in to your Facebook account, you would be redirected to the News Feed. It means your homepage consists of information and images which your friends have shared. It consists of Menu at the very left which contains quick hyperlinks to Events, fun apps and groups that you are part of.</p><p> On the top right, there is a panel which shows notifications, new friends requests and chat messages. This whole section is termed as recent activity panel.</p><p> On the very top you would see a blank space reading like ‘What’s on your mind?’ This is the publisher space where you can update status or add pictures and videos that you would like to share.</p><p> News Feed as we discussed above is what your friends are sharing for you to see. Right panel which read as trending Stories highlights the posts which other are reading and you can click on those hyperlinks for detailed story if you are interested in them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-homepage.jpg"                      alt=" facebook homepage "                ></p><h4 id="The-Timeline"><a href="#The-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="The Timeline"></a>The Timeline</h4><p> The Timeline which represents your profile and is visible to your friends and public (subject to your privacy settings) contains inventory of everything which you have shared and which people has tagged you. You can set your profile picture by simply browsing through your picture library. Profile picture is the one which your friends will see when you will comment anything on Facebook. Coverphoto is a picture which can be seen by anybody when they visit your timeline. You can set your personal picture or wallpaper also to express your personality and interests. You can make your profile more informative by adding your school, college, workplace, relationship status and your location etc.</p><p> In short, timeline shows everything which forms part of your profile and also the activities which your friends might have posted on your timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-timeline.jpg"                      alt=" facebook timeline"                ></p><h2 id="How-Facebook-usage-is-diversified"><a href="#How-Facebook-usage-is-diversified" class="headerlink" title="How Facebook usage is diversified?"></a>How Facebook usage is diversified?</h2><p> There are ample of ways to communicate and staying in touch such as emails, instant messaging or SMS but Facebook has dominated all of them except for professional workspace! Let’s check out what makes Facebook so unique and lovable that you feel like sharing the occasion and celebration with your circle in that very moment!</p><p> Things which you can do with Facebook are not limited to below:</p><ul><li>Allows you to login into different portals as websites have integrated Facebook for the login mechanism which means that with similar login credentials you can operate on different websites.</li><li>Provides a platform to connect with your idols and celebs</li><li>Gives you ample of space to share your thoughts and pictures to keep everybody updated</li><li>Chat unlimited with your online friends</li><li>Encourage your friends to join informative groups and events</li><li>Share your feelings for your friends and tag them to pictures which suit their personality</li><li>Play games and enhance your circle</li></ul><h2 id="How-Does-Facebook-Sharing-Work"><a href="#How-Does-Facebook-Sharing-Work" class="headerlink" title="How Does Facebook Sharing Work?"></a>How Does Facebook Sharing Work?</h2><p> Facebook is unique and so are the sharing norms! While your conversations at email or IM’s are private, the content that you share on Facebook including photos and links are public. This is because Facebook has emerged as an open network for communication without any sort of limitations and is thus inclined towards being public although you can define privacy and sharing settings for some shared posts.</p><p> The privacy tools can be applied on few posts and information, the remaining information (such as your cover picture) is visible to everybody. Facebook is designed to be more open and social than traditional communication tools. You will learn more in this Facebook tutorial.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-ultimate-download-manager-best-youtube-downloader-apps-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Ultimate Download Manager  Best YouTube Downloader Apps for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-art-of-social-media-videos-for-maximum-reach-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering the Art of Social Media Videos for Maximum Reach for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-copyright-clash-violation-removal-came-quick/"><u>In 2024, Copyright Clash  Violation, Removal Came Quick</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/transform-your-content-expert-techniques-for-facebook-lives/"><u>Transform Your Content  Expert Techniques for Facebook Lives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-live-streaming-pre-recorded-videos-the-facebook-approach/"><u>[Updated] Live Streaming Pre-Recorded Videos  The Facebook Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-navigating-the-top-10-ways-to-improve-fb-page-rankings/"><u>[New] Navigating the Top 10 Ways to Improve FB Page Rankings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-ghostly-witness-to-fb-vignettes/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Ghostly Witness to Fb Vignettes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-optimize-your-social-media-presence-with-mobile-based-live-videos/"><u>[New] Optimize Your Social Media Presence with Mobile-Based Live Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/ipogo-will-be-the-new-ispoofer-on-oppo-a79-5g-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>iPogo will be the new iSpoofer On Oppo A79 5G? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-pinnacle-cloud-space-for-enterprise-success/"><u>[New] Pinnacle Cloud Space for Enterprise Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-activity-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-capturing-classroom-talks-on-a-mac/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Capturing Classroom Talks on a Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-8-facebook-link-exporters-download-and-manage-effortlessly/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top 8 Facebook Link Exporters  Download & Manage Effortlessly</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-conquering-gameplay-logic-from-console-to-computer-playback-for-2024/"><u>[New] Conquering Gameplay Logic  From Console to Computer Playback for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://review-topics.techidaily.com/in-2024-can-life360-track-you-when-your-xiaomi-civi-3-disney-100th-anniversary-edition-is-off-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, Can Life360 Track You When Your Xiaomi Civi 3 Disney 100th Anniversary Edition is off? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/2024-approved-increase-fb-engagement-and-sales-the-15-most-effective-analyzers/"><u>2024 Approved  Increase FB Engagement & Sales  The 15 Most Effective Analyzers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-knowledge.techidaily.com/get-creative-streamline-your-movies-with-one-clicks-on-windows-10-for-2024/"><u>Get Creative  Streamline Your Movies with One Clicks on Windows 10 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-techniques.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-upgrade-your-mac-with-macos-sierra-simplified/"><u>[Updated] How to Upgrade Your Mac with macOS Sierra Simplified</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>
