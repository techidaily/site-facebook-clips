Many companies ignore the cover photo and put up some generic, unfocused image. It is a mistake.</p><p>The cover photo takes up a lot of room on your Facebook page, even more room than your profile picture. It should be an image that is attractive, engaging and in keeping with the brand image that you are trying to create around your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-great-cover-photo.JPG"                      alt="facebook cover photo"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Your-“About”-Page"><a href="#4-Optimize-Your-“About”-Page" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Your “About” Page"></a>4. Optimize Your “About” Page</h3><p>One of the most useful Facebook tips for business is to optimize the About section of your business page. When someone first arrives on your page and they are curious about your business, they will go to the About section to get more information.</p><p>There is also a small preview of the page that appears on your home page. It will show nuggets of information, which you can customize to include the most useful details. Your full page should describe the business and mention vital details like your location, hours, website, phone number and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/about-page-facebook.JPG"                      alt="facebook about page"                ></p><h3 id="5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button"><a href="#5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button" class="headerlink" title="5. Add a Call to Action Button"></a>5. Add a Call to Action Button</h3><p>A few years ago, Facebook added a feature that let you include a call to action on your page. For instance, you can ask someone to sign up to a mailing list, watch a video, visit your website or play a game. These calls to action are handy at moving someone from your page to another site where they can continue to learn about your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="facebook call to action"                ></p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook Jail: 10 Secrets to Avoid Being Blocked &#x2F; Get Out of It &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals"><a href="#Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals"></a>Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals</h2><h3 id="6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top"><a href="#6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top" class="headerlink" title="6. Pin a Unique or Important Post to the Top"></a>6. Pin a Unique or Important Post to the Top</h3><p>Much like you can do on Twitter, it is possible to pin a useful or relevant post to the top of your page. Say it is a post that went viral and you want others who come on your page to learn about it. You could place that post on the top by pinning it there, even if you have newer posts.</p><h3 id="7-Share-Unique-Content"><a href="#7-Share-Unique-Content" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Unique Content"></a>7. Share Unique Content</h3><p>Companies fall into the trap of just posting self-promoting links to their site or other social media channels. While these links are useful when posted on occasion, they should not make up your entire feed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://louisem.com/84350/how-to-create-facebook-content" >You need authentic and interesting posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that your followers would find interesting. That will lead to more reactions and comments, which will help get your posts higher up on Facebook pages for related keywords or hashtags.</p><h3 id="8-Pay-Attention-to-Post-Timing"><a href="#8-Pay-Attention-to-Post-Timing" class="headerlink" title="8. Pay Attention to Post Timing"></a>8. Pay Attention to Post Timing</h3><p>It may sound odd, but the time when you post on Facebook matters a great deal. Early afternoons during the weekday is often the best time to post. It may be that more people are scrolling through their feed and willing to click on links during those times!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="facebook posting time"                ></p><h3 id="9-Response-Time-Matters"><a href="#9-Response-Time-Matters" class="headerlink" title="9. Response Time Matters"></a>9. Response Time Matters</h3><p>When someone posts a comment on your post that is asking a question, it is imperative that you respond quickly. If a customer has a query about your business or a product they bought, they expect an answer within four hours.</p><p>And the average brand takes around 10 hours to respond. It is a serious disconnect. By the time most brands respond, the person has already moved on. You may want to ensure that your social media team is tuned into responding quicker to such posts.</p><h3 id="10-Post-Great-Blog-Content"><a href="#10-Post-Great-Blog-Content" class="headerlink" title="10. Post Great Blog Content"></a>10. Post Great Blog Content</h3><p>Do not treat your blog content as a second class citizen. Give it the promotion it deserves. The most helpful and engaging blog posts will help get you better performance on your Facebook page as well. These posts are helpful and interesting to your target audience - the people following your page!</p><h3 id="11-Promote-Your-Account-to-Add-Followers"><a href="#11-Promote-Your-Account-to-Add-Followers" class="headerlink" title="11. Promote Your Account to Add Followers"></a>11. Promote Your Account to Add Followers</h3><p>Among our Facebook business page tips, it is surprising how many companies do not know they can promote a page to get more followers. You can create an ad within Facebook and target people using precise metrics. It is a great way to create an ad campaign that is targeted, financially prudent and yields good results.</p><h3 id="12-Leverage-Facebook-Insights"><a href="#12-Leverage-Facebook-Insights" class="headerlink" title="12. Leverage Facebook Insights"></a>12. Leverage Facebook Insights</h3><p>Facebook has an internal analytics tool called Facebook Insights. The final bit of advice among our Facebook tips for business is that you must take advantage of this tool. It has analytics data about how many people are visiting your page and how often they are engaging with your posts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-insights.JPG"                      alt="Facebook Insights"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Facebook tips for business are more important now than ever before. The social media site has an enormous user base, while it has made changes to its algorithm in the past few months. The Facebook tips we have highlighted above should help your business navigate through the social media marketing process in a better way.</p><p>If you want to edit Facebook video, try Filmora to easily better your video with more than 150 effects.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><h5 id="Liza-Brown-1"><a href="#Liza-Brown-1" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p><p>While Facebook has gone through some tough times in the past couple years, it is still seen as the most impressive, populated and important social media site in the world.

Optimize Your “About” Page"></a>4. Optimize Your “About” Page</h3><p>One of the most useful Facebook tips for business is to optimize the About section of your business page. When someone first arrives on your page and they are curious about your business, they will go to the About section to get more information.</p><p>There is also a small preview of the page that appears on your home page. It will show nuggets of information, which you can customize to include the most useful details. Your full page should describe the business and mention vital details like your location, hours, website, phone number and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/about-page-facebook.JPG"                      alt="facebook about page"                ></p><h3 id="5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button-3"><a href="#5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button-3" class="headerlink" title="5. Add a Call to Action Button"></a>5. Add a Call to Action Button</h3><p>A few years ago, Facebook added a feature that let you include a call to action on your page. For instance, you can ask someone to sign up to a mailing list, watch a video, visit your website or play a game. These calls to action are handy at moving someone from your page to another site where they can continue to learn about your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="facebook call to action"                ></p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook Jail: 10 Secrets to Avoid Being Blocked &#x2F; Get Out of It &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals-3"><a href="#Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals"></a>Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals</h2><h3 id="6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top-3"><a href="#6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top-3" class="headerlink" title="6. Pin a Unique or Important Post to the Top"></a>6. Pin a Unique or Important Post to the Top</h3><p>Much like you can do on Twitter, it is possible to pin a useful or relevant post to the top of your page. Say it is a post that went viral and you want others who come on your page to learn about it. You could place that post on the top by pinning it there, even if you have newer posts.</p><h3 id="7-Share-Unique-Content-3"><a href="#7-Share-Unique-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Unique Content"></a>7. Share Unique Content</h3><p>Companies fall into the trap of just posting self-promoting links to their site or other social media channels. While these links are useful when posted on occasion, they should not make up your entire feed.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://louisem.com/84350/how-to-create-facebook-content" >You need authentic and interesting posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that your followers would find interesting. That will lead to more reactions and comments, which will help get your posts higher up on Facebook pages for related keywords or hashtags.</p><h3 id="8-Pay-Attention-to-Post-Timing-3"><a href="#8-Pay-Attention-to-Post-Timing-3" class="headerlink" title="8. Pay Attention to Post Timing"></a>8. Pay Attention to Post Timing</h3><p>It may sound odd, but the time when you post on Facebook matters a great deal. Early afternoons during the weekday is often the best time to post. It may be that more people are scrolling through their feed and willing to click on links during those times!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="facebook posting time"                ></p><h3 id="9-Response-Time-Matters-3"><a href="#9-Response-Time-Matters-3" class="headerlink" title="9. Response Time Matters"></a>9. Response Time Matters</h3><p>When someone posts a comment on your post that is asking a question, it is imperative that you respond quickly. If a customer has a query about your business or a product they bought, they expect an answer within four hours.</p><p>And the average brand takes around 10 hours to respond. It is a serious disconnect. By the time most brands respond, the person has already moved on. You may want to ensure that your social media team is tuned into responding quicker to such posts.</p><h3 id="10-Post-Great-Blog-Content-3"><a href="#10-Post-Great-Blog-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="10. Post Great Blog Content"></a>10. Post Great Blog Content</h3><p>Do not treat your blog content as a second class citizen. Give it the promotion it deserves. The most helpful and engaging blog posts will help get you better performance on your Facebook page as well. These posts are helpful and interesting to your target audience - the people following your page!</p><h3 id="11-Promote-Your-Account-to-Add-Followers-3"><a href="#11-Promote-Your-Account-to-Add-Followers-3" class="headerlink" title="11. Promote Your Account to Add Followers"></a>11. Promote Your Account to Add Followers</h3><p>Among our Facebook business page tips, it is surprising how many companies do not know they can promote a page to get more followers. You can create an ad within Facebook and target people using precise metrics. It is a great way to create an ad campaign that is targeted, financially prudent and yields good results.</p><h3 id="12-Leverage-Facebook-Insights-3"><a href="#12-Leverage-Facebook-Insights-3" class="headerlink" title="12. Leverage Facebook Insights"></a>12. Leverage Facebook Insights</h3><p>Facebook has an internal analytics tool called Facebook Insights. The final bit of advice among our Facebook tips for business is that you must take advantage of this tool. It has analytics data about how many people are visiting your page and how often they are engaging with your posts.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-insights.JPG"                      alt="Facebook Insights"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Facebook tips for business are more important now than ever before.

Dumbfounded by the car’s potential, Henry Ford II allows Ken Miles to race Daytona on Shelby’s request overriding Leo Beebe’s order.</p><p>Towards the end of the clip, Ken Miles appears to be losing the Daytona event, but with a secret trick up their sleeves, Carrol Shelby clears Miles to push the car beyond the 7000 RPM tachometer red line.</p><p>Everyone is skeptical about pushing the car to its limits, but Ken Miles, knowing what he built, pushes the car in the last lap and, to everyone’s surprise, passes all the cars and wins the event. The end of the video shows his team shouting and cheering him up and a disappointed and fumed Leo Beebe.</p><p>The link to the video is as follows:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://fb.watch/a4y44xCDLr/" >The Ford GT… Ford v Ferrari <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Video-number-2-Asking-Superyacht-Owners-What-They-Do-For-a-Living"><a href="#Video-number-2-Asking-Superyacht-Owners-What-They-Do-For-a-Living" class="headerlink" title="Video number 2: Asking Superyacht Owners What They Do For a Living"></a>Video number 2: Asking Superyacht Owners What They Do For a Living</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-trending-videos-on-facebook-files-2.jpg"                      alt="Asking Superyacht Owners What They Do For a Living"                ></p><p>This video is uploaded on the Facebook page by ‘LADbible Australia’ and is titled ‘This lad asked superyacht owners what they do for a living.

From being a platform where people could share their thoughts about their daily lives, Facebook eventually became everything people utilized to connect with the world. From messaging to sharing your stories, Facebook provided personal and professional features across the platform, making billions of users interact.</p><p>Videos are a common part of the platform where people consider this visual form of communication as a proficient way to express anything. From an idea to something that would make you laugh, Facebook caters to all kinds of videos across its social media platform. While going through Facebook, you prefer the video to play automatically to make it easy for you to go through the platform.</p><p>For this, <strong>the Facebook Autoplay</strong> feature provides you an impressive option to automatically play videos for yourself; without tapping any post to watch them. This article features the <strong>Facebook video autoplay</strong> feature and provides users with a detailed guide on <strong>autoplay on Facebook.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">What is Facebook Autoplay</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Guide on How to Autoplay Facebook Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">How Autoplay Feature Can Bother You in Using Facebook?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Facebook-Autoplay"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Facebook-Autoplay" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Facebook Autoplay"></a>Part 1: What is Facebook Autoplay</h2><p>Facebook believes in efficiency and human-friendliness. The platform provides features of different contexts driven by efficiency and human-friendliness. While allowing users to add videos to Facebook with its proficient tools under a few restrictions, Facebook also believes in making things simpler for its viewers. For this, the <strong>Facebook autoplay</strong> feature plays a pivotal role in providing ease to the viewers in going through videos.</p><p>The autoplay feature on Facebook explains as the tool that automatically plays the video for the users across the page it appears. Rather than tapping and letting it load, Facebook does this automatically for you, enabling the prolific display of the video without waiting for it to load. Autoplay provides many benefits to its users in multiple ways. From getting a teaser of the video before watching it in its entirety to making your scrolling efficient, <strong>Facebook video autoplay</strong> has proved to be quite effective.</p><p>While realizing the purpose of autoplay across Facebook videos, the user can specify several options to make the feature effective according to their requirements. When using the Autoplay feature on Facebook, users can set four different options according to their discretion. To make the tool effective, you can set it up across mobile data and Wi-Fi. However, you can turn towards the Wi-Fi-only option to save the internet.</p><p>The autoplay feature is not a mandatory option for users to manage. This feature can be easily turned off, giving people control over what and what not to play. On the other hand, using <strong>autoplay on Facebook</strong> also provides users with playing the video with sound. However, this is completely under the hands of the user, who select the best option according to their requirements.</p><p>Following this, <strong>Facebook autoplay</strong> potentially works if the device’s battery is up and running. Facebook automatically turns off this option to optimize battery life on a low battery.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Guide-on-How-to-Autoplay-Facebook-Videos"><a href="#Part-2-Guide-on-How-to-Autoplay-Facebook-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Guide on How to Autoplay Facebook Videos"></a>Part 2: Guide on How to Autoplay Facebook Videos</h2><p>This part provides users with a guide on autoplay a video on Facebook across multiple devices.

However, there are some drawbacks to utilizing this feature. Some users do not prefer turning this feature across their devices for specific reasons. To understand why <strong>autoplay on Facebook</strong> can bother you, you need to look across the following reasons in detail.</p><h3 id="Putting-in-Awkward-Situations"><a href="#Putting-in-Awkward-Situations" class="headerlink" title="Putting in Awkward Situations"></a>Putting in Awkward Situations</h3><p><strong>Facebook video autoplay</strong> makes video run automatically while scrolling down the platform. There are several instances where you may feel uneasy about listening to sounds after every other video passes by. For example, if you are sitting in a library and going through Facebook for some reason, the sound of the video can surely make things very awkward for you.</p><p>It is highly advisable that users can turn off the autoplay feature under such circumstances, as it would allow them to stay out of situations that would make them confused while sitting anywhere.</p><h3 id="Use-of-Data"><a href="#Use-of-Data" class="headerlink" title="Use of Data"></a>Use of Data</h3><p>There are cases where the autoplay feature across Facebook is turned on in conditions that consume unnecessary mobile phone data. If you have restricted access to mobile data with a limit, having the feature turned on across mobile data would even consume MBs, putting you in complicated situations.</p><p>In other cases, this can potentially cost your extra mobile services, which can turn out to be monetarily expensive.</p><h3 id="Consumption-of-Battery"><a href="#Consumption-of-Battery" class="headerlink" title="Consumption of Battery"></a>Consumption of Battery</h3><p>The mobile data turned on across your device can consume your battery faster. The unnecessary play of the video consumes the battery and can leave you in situations where you may not have any access to a battery source. To avoid discrepancies under such circumstances, it is advised to turn off the <strong>Facebook autoplay</strong> feature as it would save battery for you, keeping your device turned on for a longer time.</p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>This article has addressed the autoplay feature of Facebook in detail.

From being a platform where people could share their thoughts about their daily lives, Facebook eventually became everything people utilized to connect with the world. From messaging to sharing your stories, Facebook provided personal and professional features across the platform, making billions of users interact.</p><p>Videos are a common part of the platform where people consider this visual form of communication as a proficient way to express anything. From an idea to something that would make you laugh, Facebook caters to all kinds of videos across its social media platform. While going through Facebook, you prefer the video to play automatically to make it easy for you to go through the platform.</p><p>For this, <strong>the Facebook Autoplay</strong> feature provides you an impressive option to automatically play videos for yourself; without tapping any post to watch them. This article features the <strong>Facebook video autoplay</strong> feature and provides users with a detailed guide on <strong>autoplay on Facebook.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">What is Facebook Autoplay</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">Guide on How to Autoplay Facebook Videos</a></p><p>Part 3: <a href="#step3">How Autoplay Feature Can Bother You in Using Facebook?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Facebook-Autoplay-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Facebook-Autoplay-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Facebook Autoplay"></a>Part 1: What is Facebook Autoplay</h2><p>Facebook believes in efficiency and human-friendliness. The platform provides features of different contexts driven by efficiency and human-friendliness. While allowing users to add videos to Facebook with its proficient tools under a few restrictions, Facebook also believes in making things simpler for its viewers. For this, the <strong>Facebook autoplay</strong> feature plays a pivotal role in providing ease to the viewers in going through videos.</p><p>The autoplay feature on Facebook explains as the tool that automatically plays the video for the users across the page it appears. Rather than tapping and letting it load, Facebook does this automatically for you, enabling the prolific display of the video without waiting for it to load. Autoplay provides many benefits to its users in multiple ways. From getting a teaser of the video before watching it in its entirety to making your scrolling efficient, <strong>Facebook video autoplay</strong> has proved to be quite effective.</p><p>While realizing the purpose of autoplay across Facebook videos, the user can specify several options to make the feature effective according to their requirements. When using the Autoplay feature on Facebook, users can set four different options according to their discretion. To make the tool effective, you can set it up across mobile data and Wi-Fi. However, you can turn towards the Wi-Fi-only option to save the internet.</p><p>The autoplay feature is not a mandatory option for users to manage. This feature can be easily turned off, giving people control over what and what not to play. On the other hand, using <strong>autoplay on Facebook</strong> also provides users with playing the video with sound. However, this is completely under the hands of the user, who select the best option according to their requirements.</p><p>Following this, <strong>Facebook autoplay</strong> potentially works if the device’s battery is up and running.

As Facebook is becoming of the biggest live-sharing platforms in the world. It makes sense to have the convenience of streaming anywhere or anytime. Without further ado, let’s get into it. There’s no way around using a third-party app when you’re trying to share your screen on Facebook live.</p><p>The screen recording feature is not native to android. So, we need other apps to help bridge the gap. One such app is CameraFi Live. Let’s see how we can use it to</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install both Facebook and CameraFi Live app. This app allows you to stream videos live across multiple social media platforms.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-1.png"                      alt="use camerafi live app"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Go to the app, and agree with the terms of use.

Alternatively, select ‘Screen’ to stream what your phone does.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-3.png"                      alt="use camerafi live one month trial"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> After this, you can choose which platform you want to stream on.

You can choose to stream to your Timeline, Pages, or Groups. Once chosen, it will take you to the home page. Tap start to go live.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-5.png"                      alt="stream android screen on facebook timeline"                ></p><p>With this, you can easily use Facebook live on android. At the end of the broadcast, you can choose to save, delete or share your live video. Facebook live also comes with the option to raise money for a cause. Facebook provides an option to donate money during your stream. You can donate this to a non-profit or charitable organization.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Share-Facebook-Live-Screen-on-iPhone"><a href="#Part-2-Share-Facebook-Live-Screen-on-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

This page gives you many options on how to set up your stream. Look at the left-side panel options. You can choose which camera you want as your input source. Select the microphone you want to use on the page. Below the microphone icon is the button for ‘Start Screen Share.’</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-12.png"                      alt="share screen on facebook live"                ></p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Once you click on ‘Start Screen Share,’ a new dialog box pops open. It gives you the option of sharing’ Entire Screen.’, ‘Window,’ or ‘Chrome Tabs.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Under the ‘Entire Screen’ option, you can share the current window open as ‘Screen 1’. You can also share your desktop background if you choose. This shows up as ‘Screen 2’. Once you’ve made your choice, tap on the ‘Share’ button. This creates a “Post Preview.” You can see what the post will look like when it goes live. Click on ‘Next’ on the bottom left of the screen to continue.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-13.png"                      alt="fill in title on facebook live video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Simply fill out the live stream post details on the left side panel. Fill out details like the live stream title in the ‘Title Required’ box. You can add additional descriptions in the prompt box beneath the title box. Click on ‘Next’ when you’re done filling in the details.</p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> You’ll now see the Dashboard. Beneath the Dashboard, you can spot the ‘Go Live’ button. Once you’re happy with the live video setup, you can click on the ‘Go Live’ button. The live video is set up with a countdown from three to one. Your video then goes live.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-live-screen-share-14.png"                      alt="go live using screen share on facebook"                ></p><p>One drawback to the Facebook live screen share function is that you can’t show your face.
