Create Trendy Content"></a>1. Create Trendy Content</h3><p> The simplest way to boost engagement levels on Facebook is by creating content that will trend. Whether it is a blog post, picture, video or even a meme, getting something trending can add a significant amount of followers to a page.</p><p> Companies can identify trending topics by seeing what is making the headlines at major sites, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" >Buzzfeed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it shows the topics that people are talking about at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/increase-followers-trendy-content.JPG"                      alt="Create Trendy Content"                ></p><h3 id="2-Don’t-Ignore-the-Power-of-Email"><a href="#2-Don’t-Ignore-the-Power-of-Email" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Ignore the Power of Email"></a>2. Don’t Ignore the Power of Email</h3><p> If your company already has a significant email list for marketing purposes, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-social-email/" >targeting that email list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to boost Facebook follower counts is a great idea. When you send a newsletter to your mail list, make sure you add a call to action regarding Facebook.</p><p> Encourage them to like your page so they can get the latest updates, discounts and other valuable content! Even if you get a percentage of those on the email list to follower your account, it will be a great help as you attempt to boost your follower count.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/email-increase-facebook-follower.JPG"                      alt="email increse facebook follower"                ></p><h3 id="3-Use-the-Facebook-Follow-Button"><a href="#3-Use-the-Facebook-Follow-Button" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Facebook Follow Button"></a>3. Use the Facebook Follow Button</h3><p> Companies would be surprised at the amount of users who want to check out their social media pages, but are not sure if they exist. When someone visits your website, there should be a clear button present to indicate you are on that social media platform.</p><p> You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.dummies.com/business/marketing/social-media-marketing/how-to-activate-the-follow-button-on-a-facebook-personal-profile/" >create your own Facebook follow button <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which you can place on various pages on your website. When users click on that button, they will go directly to your Facebook page. If they are already signed into the site, they just have to click the follow button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/follow-button.JPG"                      alt="facebook follow button"                ></p><h3 id="4-Create-Facebook-Videos"><a href="#4-Create-Facebook-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Create Facebook Videos"></a>4. Create Facebook Videos</h3><p> Statistics show that videos get a lot more traction and response from users on Facebook. Showcasing interesting video content about your company, products or services is a great way to gain more followers.</p><p> A Facebook video should be short and sweet - getting to the point immediately. Videos could tease products and services, announce discounts, or offer a behind the scenes look at how the company is run.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video.JPG"                      alt="facebook video"                ></p><h3 id="5-Write-a-Great-Introduction"><a href="#5-Write-a-Great-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="5. Write a Great Introduction"></a>5. Write a Great Introduction</h3><p> Do not ignore the “About” section on your Facebook profile. When you fill in that section with all the relevant information, people will have an easier time seeing your page on search results pages.</p><p> Not only do you show up higher on Facebook searches, but also on Google search engine rankings. Information such as the company name, address, number, mission statement and other details should be included in the about section. The more people know, the better your profile comes across.</p><h3 id="6-Add-Hashtags-to-the-Post"><a href="#6-Add-Hashtags-to-the-Post" class="headerlink" title="6. Add Hashtags to the Post"></a>6. Add Hashtags to the Post</h3><p> Many companies still associate hashtags with Twitter. But they have become a critical part of interacting on Facebook as well. When a person clicks on a hashtag or enters it in the search bar, they can see all relevant posts with that hashtag.</p><p> When you are attempting to create trending content, <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/using-hashtags-on-facebook" >adding hashtags is a helpful way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get more people to notice and read your posts. Even people who do not follow your page will be able to see your posts, especially if they begin to trend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-hashtag.JPG"                      alt="use hashtag increase follower"                ></p><h3 id="7-Try-Facebook-Live"><a href="#7-Try-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="7. Try Facebook Live"></a>7. Try Facebook Live</h3><p> Facebook Live offers a great opportunity for companies to live stream with their viewers, giving them personalized and behind the scenes access into operations.</p><p> When someone is following your page, they get a notification that you are in a live stream. They can even interact with the video with likes or by commenting. Live videos can also help build an audience as other people tune into your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-live.JPG"                      alt="facebook live"                ></p><h3 id="8-Consider-Cooperating-with-Other-Influencers"><a href="#8-Consider-Cooperating-with-Other-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="8. Consider Cooperating with Other Influencers"></a>8. Consider Cooperating with Other Influencers</h3><p> Do not be afraid to engage with your audience. A Facebook account is not just for status updates or company information. It is a place where you can directly connect with your audience.</p><p> Answering questions, providing clever replies and other ways of interaction can help make your brand feel more personal. You can also interact with influencers who have a huge follower count, especially if you already have a positive working relationship with those influencers.</p><h3 id="9-Post-at-the-Right-Time"><a href="#9-Post-at-the-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="9. Post at the Right Time"></a>9. Post at the Right Time</h3><p> When you post matters just as much as what you post, especially if you want to boost engagement. Studies show that if you post between 1pm and 4pm from Thursday to Sunday, you have a chance of getting around 20 to 30 percent more engagement.</p><p> The study showed that 3pm is best if you want more clicks, while 1pm gets you a lot of shares. Those who want to build up their follower count should focus on shares, which means posting around 1pm from Thursday to Sunday!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="posting time"                ></p><h3 id="10-Take-Risks"><a href="#10-Take-Risks" class="headerlink" title="10. Take Risks"></a>10. Take Risks</h3><p> Playing it safe is fine for major companies that already have a lot of brand awareness, loyalty and a huge follower count. Companies that want to make a splash and gain more traction should not be afraid to take risks with posts, replies and videos.</p><p> Taking risks does not mean saying something insensitive, rude or alienating. It is important to toe the line and to know when a bit of edgy humor can be helpful. Companies that can find the right balance will have a lot of success in gaining followers.</p><h2 id="Conslusionc"><a href="#Conslusionc" class="headerlink" title="Conslusionc"></a>Conslusionc</h2><p> The process of how to increase followers on Facebook is relatively simple, especially when it is broken down into steps. But it can be so important for brands to understand how they can boost their follower count and gain greater brand awareness on the social media platform. It will also help you connect with more powerful influencers, which will only boost your brand even more!</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-perfecting-profile-playlists-on-facebook-through-mobile/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  Perfecting Profile Playlists on Facebook Through Mobile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/escape-plan-dodge-facebook-lockdowns-effectively-for-2024/"><u>Escape Plan  Dodge Facebook Lockdowns Effectively for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-tackling-blurry-youtube-videos-fixing-visual-fuzziness/"><u>In 2024, Tackling Blurry YouTube Videos  Fixing Visual Fuzziness</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-the-time-travel-of-facebook-memories-via-devices/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating the Time Travel of Facebook Memories via Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-veiled-viewer-in-the-social-sphere/"><u>[Updated] Veiled Viewer in the Social Sphere</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-mastering-quick-profile-retrieval-on-facebook/"><u>[New] Mastering Quick Profile Retrieval on Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-behind-the-scenes-creating-10-facebook-videos/"><u>2024 Approved  From Behind the Scenes  Creating #10 Facebook Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unleashing-potential-a-guide-to-setting-up-and-analyzing-instream-ads-in-fb/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unleashing Potential  A Guide to Setting Up & Analyzing Instream Ads in FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://eaxpv-info.techidaily.com/updated-from-first-to-last-your-guide-to-youtube-video-looping-101-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] From First to Last  Your Guide to YouTube Video Looping 101 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-ending-static-audio-in-obs-streams/"><u>[Updated] Ending Static Audio in OBS Streams</u></a></li><li><a href="https://desktop-recording.techidaily.com/new-enhancing-your-videography-skills-with-mac-webcam-top-techniques-for-2024/"><u>[New] Enhancing Your Videography Skills with Mac Webcam - Top Techniques for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/universal-unlock-pattern-for-vivo-x100-by-drfone-android/"><u>Universal Unlock Pattern for Vivo X100</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-videos.techidaily.com/2024-approved-avoiding-poverty-earning-in-beauty-media/"><u>2024 Approved  Avoiding Poverty  Earning in Beauty Media</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-ultimate-list-of-ps2-games-for-ios-emulation/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved  The Ultimate List of PS2 Games for iOS Emulation</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-clips.techidaily.com/elevate-your-streaming-experience-six-insightful-quizzes-for-fandom-enthusiasts/"><u>Elevate Your Streaming Experience  Six Insightful Quizzes for Fandom Enthusiasts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-stream.techidaily.com/2024-approved-trending-tracks-a-list-of-popular-audio-for-cutting-edge-video-shorts/"><u>2024 Approved  Trending Tracks  A List of Popular Audio for Cutting-Edge Video Shorts</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/updated-leveraging-engagement-for-higher-facebook-profile-visibility-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Leveraging Engagement for Higher Facebook Profile Visibility for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>]]></content>

In August, 2011 the facebook chat was replaced by Messenger but you can use Messenger even when you don’t have a facebook account. The app can be used on web, desktop and mobile apps, including Android and Apple, which makes it compatible with the Apple watch.</p><p>Essentially, Messenger is a texting app that allows you to text a person one-on-one or chat in a group. Upon all that messenger allows you to use emojis that reflect your emotions. But, the best part is how you can easily share videos, pictures and documents in Messenger.</p><p>Facebook Messenger comes with an array of great features including reacting on messages and media, read receipts, time stamps on messages, customizing your chat style etc.</p><p>Amongst all the fantastic features of Facebook Messenger, it collects all the media files you share in a chat and stores them in a single folder.

Each one aims to help you reach your goal - whether that’s video views, leading people to your website, or getting them to buy your product. Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.</p><p>You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad won’t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client. Once you’ve got that out the way, you can look at doing the actual creation work.</p><h4 id="2-Choosing-A-Format"><a href="#2-Choosing-A-Format" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing A Format"></a>2. Choosing A Format</h4><p>Once you’ve gone through the initial info, you need to choose a format for your ad.

Here, we’ll choose Single Image or Video format to show the next steps. Once you’ve got the hang of it, you can experiment with the other two.</p><h4 id="3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements"><a href="#3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3.  Adding Your Media &amp; Elements"></a>3.  Adding Your Media &amp; Elements</h4><p>Go to the <strong>Media</strong> section and now you can upload up to 10 images or videos and Facebook Dynamic Creative will generate multiple combinations; or, you can create slideshow or use the Video Template to create a new video with the Video Creation Kit.</p><p><strong>Add images to media</strong></p><p>Once you’ve begun to create your vid, you’ll find a button under the <strong>Media</strong> tab. Click Add Image and a window will open for you to select images - you can choose from the images on your account, your particular Facebook page you’re creating the ad for, your Instagram, or upload stock images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-assets.jpg"                      alt="add Facebook ads image assets"                ></p><p>When adding images to media, remember to choose images that are the same size and orientation. This will make your life easier and your ad look more appealing!</p><p>Also, it would be helpful to check the <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/image" >image specs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/video" >video specs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before uploading.</p><p>If you want a slideshow ad that will simply scroll through the media you’ve selected and that you can add some extra text and info onto, head a little further down the page to add your text and links and finish up by clicking <strong>Confirm</strong>.</p><p>If you want to create a video, the process is a little different, but not much more complicated.</p><h4 id="4-Creating-Your-Video-with-Templates"><a href="#4-Creating-Your-Video-with-Templates" class="headerlink" title="4.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds.

We often find ourselves in a situation where we see something funny or interesting on YouTube and immediately want to share it on our Facebook.</p><p>We can easily share YouTube videos on Facebook. Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.</p><p>However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.</p><p>So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On&#x2F;Off?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?"></a>Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</h2><p>The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.</p><p>Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.</p><p>Now the question is, what can you do?</p><p>There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.</p><h3 id="First-Method"><a href="#First-Method" class="headerlink" title="First Method"></a>First Method</h3><p>The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.</p><p>One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.</p><p>We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel</strong></p><p>The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Go to the YouTube channel and select the video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu</strong></p><p>Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu. You will see a lot of different tabs here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Look for the Syndicate Option</strong></p><p>In the drop-down menu, look for the Syndicate tab. Under it, click on “Publish to Facebook” to transfer the video to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="search for the Syndicate tab to “Publish video on Facebook”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Set the Desired Settings</strong></p><p>A dialog box will appear where you can enter your Facebook account, set the title, adjust the description, set the publish time, and set the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="Set the Desired Settings"                ></p><p>Once you are done, click on “Publish to Facebook,” and voila!</p><p>Now, your YouTube video will be uploaded on your Facebook page as a video and will play automatically as the rest of the Facebook videos do.</p><h3 id="Second-Method"><a href="#Second-Method" class="headerlink" title="Second Method"></a>Second Method</h3><p>The second method of ensuring the autoplay feature works with your videos is to upload them directly from your computer.

Just a quick Google search will help you out with finding one.</p><p>Paste the URL in the app or website. Then download the video.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Upload the Video to Facebook.</strong></p><p>Once you have the video on your computer, go to Facebook. On the home page, you will see an option to upload a Photo&#x2F;Video below the status bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Status bar"                ></p><p>Click on it, select the video you want to upload, and then post it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>You can use this particular method for uploading any video that you have on your computer.

We often find ourselves in a situation where we see something funny or interesting on YouTube and immediately want to share it on our Facebook.</p><p>We can easily share YouTube videos on Facebook. Here is the complete guide on sharing youtube videos on Facebook.</p><p>However, when you share something from YouTube to Facebook, it adds an embed link, and the video does not support autoplay on Facebook.</p><p>So, to help you avoid that problem, we will give you a step-by-step guide in this article.</p><h4 id="In-this-article-3"><a href="#In-this-article-3" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>Part 1: <a href="#step1">Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</a></p><p>Part 2: <a href="#step2">How to Turn Facebook Video Autoplay On&#x2F;Off?</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook-3"><a href="#Part-1-Can-I-Play-YouTube-Videos-Automatically-on-Facebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?"></a>Part 1: Can I Play YouTube Videos Automatically on Facebook?</h2><p>The YouTube videos that you share on Facebook do not play automatically. Facebook does not give the privilege to YouTube to play videos on their platform.</p><p>Thus, when you share a YouTube video on Facebook, it shows in the form of a link instead of a video player.</p><p>Now the question is, what can you do?</p><p>There are two ways you can go about in order to enable the autoplay feature for your YouTube videos.</p><h3 id="First-Method-3"><a href="#First-Method-3" class="headerlink" title="First Method"></a>First Method</h3><p>The first method that we will introduce here is for those who have a YouTube channel of their own and want to transfer their videos from YouTube to Facebook and enable autoplay.</p><p>The unfortunate thing is that YouTube does not have a feature that allows you to share videos as videos instead of an embed link. So, we look at third-party apps for help.</p><p>One of such third-party apps is TubeBuddy. It is an amazing app for YouTube Channel Management that we will use here to solve our little problem.</p><p>We will now provide you with a step-by-step guide for uploading your YouTube videos to Facebook with the help of TubeBuddy.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Go to your YouTube Channel</strong></p><p>The first step is to go to your YouTube channel and select the video you want to share.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-1.jpg"                      alt="Go to the YouTube channel and select the video"                ></p><p><strong>Step 2: Go to the TubeBuddy Dropdown Menu</strong></p><p>Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu. You will see a lot of different tabs here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-2.jpg"                      alt="Click on the TubeBuddy Dropdown menu."                ></p><p><strong>Step 3: Look for the Syndicate Option</strong></p><p>In the drop-down menu, look for the Syndicate tab. Under it, click on “Publish to Facebook” to transfer the video to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-3.jpg"                      alt="search for the Syndicate tab to “Publish video on Facebook”"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4: Set the Desired Settings</strong></p><p>A dialog box will appear where you can enter your Facebook account, set the title, adjust the description, set the publish time, and set the thumbnail.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-4.jpg"                      alt="Set the Desired Settings"                ></p><p>Once you are done, click on “Publish to Facebook,” and voila!</p><p>Now, your YouTube video will be uploaded on your Facebook page as a video and will play automatically as the rest of the Facebook videos do.</p><h3 id="Second-Method-3"><a href="#Second-Method-3" class="headerlink" title="Second Method"></a>Second Method</h3><p>The second method of ensuring the autoplay feature works with your videos is to upload them directly from your computer. You can also download videos from YouTube using third-party services and then upload them on Facebook.</p><p>The step-by-step guide is given below.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Search and Open the Video</strong></p><p>Go to YouTube, search for the video you want to share on Facebook, and open it.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Copy the URL</strong></p><p>At the top of the page, copy the URL of the page.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Use Any Third-Party Service</strong></p><p>Some different third-party apps and websites help you convert and download YouTube videos. Just a quick Google search will help you out with finding one.</p><p>Paste the URL in the app or website. Then download the video.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Upload the Video to Facebook.</strong></p><p>Once you have the video on your computer, go to Facebook. On the home page, you will see an option to upload a Photo&#x2F;Video below the status bar.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/autoplay-youtube-videos-on-facebook-5.jpg"                      alt="Status bar"                ></p><p>Click on it, select the video you want to upload, and then post it.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong></p><p>You can use this particular method for uploading any video that you have on your computer.

It is a place where you can directly connect with your audience.</p><p> Answering questions, providing clever replies and other ways of interaction can help make your brand feel more personal. You can also interact with influencers who have a huge follower count, especially if you already have a positive working relationship with those influencers.</p><h3 id="9-Post-at-the-Right-Time"><a href="#9-Post-at-the-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="9.

Companies that want to make a splash and gain more traction should not be afraid to take risks with posts, replies and videos.</p><p> Taking risks does not mean saying something insensitive, rude or alienating. It is important to toe the line and to know when a bit of edgy humor can be helpful. Companies that can find the right balance will have a lot of success in gaining followers.</p><h2 id="Conslusionc"><a href="#Conslusionc" class="headerlink" title="Conslusionc"></a>Conslusionc</h2><p> The process of how to increase followers on Facebook is relatively simple, especially when it is broken down into steps.

There are a few things to keep in mind when creating your image:</p><ul><li>Use high-quality images that are eye-catching and relevant to your product or service.</li><li>Make sure your text is easy to read, and avoid overcrowding your image with too much information.</li><li>Make sure your branding is consistent across all of your marketing materials.</li><li>Keep your target audience in mind when creating your image.</li></ul><h2 id="Why-make-a-creative-image-for-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#Why-make-a-creative-image-for-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Why make a creative image for Facebook Ads"></a>Why make a creative image for Facebook Ads</h2><p>There are a few reasons why you need to make a creative image before running a Facebook an Ad:</p><p>First, an eye-catching image will help to grab the reader’s attention and make them more likely to read your ad.</p><p>Second, including relevant images with your ad will help to illustrate your product or service and make it easier for your audience to understand what you’re selling.</p><p>And finally, having consistent branding across all of your marketing materials will help to create a professional image for your business.</p><h2 id="Difference-between-Facebook-Ads-and-Facebook-Post"><a href="#Difference-between-Facebook-Ads-and-Facebook-Post" class="headerlink" title="Difference between Facebook Ads and Facebook Post"></a>Difference between Facebook Ads and Facebook Post</h2><p>A Facebook post is simply a message that you post on your Facebook page. A Facebook ad is a message that you pay to have displayed on other people’s Facebook pages. There are a few key differences between Facebook posts and ads:</p><ul><li>Facebook posts are free to create, while Facebook ads require a payment.</li><li>Facebook posts are only visible to people who have liked your page, while Facebook ads can be targeted to specific audiences.</li><li>Facebook ads can include more information than posts, including clickable links and images.</li><li>Facebook ads will always be shown in the News Feed, while Facebook posts may not be seen by all of your followers.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/facebook-feeds.jpg"                      alt="facebook feeds"                ></p><p>Now that you know the difference between a Facebook post and an ad, let’s take a look at how to create an effective ad.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-effective-facebook-ads.jpg"                      alt="create effective facebook ads"                ></p><h2 id="The-Three-Simple-Copywriting-Structures"><a href="#The-Three-Simple-Copywriting-Structures" class="headerlink" title="The Three Simple Copywriting Structures"></a>The Three Simple Copywriting Structures</h2><p><strong>#1. Connect to the Pain of your Target Audience</strong></p><p>The first step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to connect with the pain of your target audience. What problem are they trying to solve? What need do they have that your product or service can fill?</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to speak to the pain of being overweight or feeling self-conscious about one’s appearance.</p><p><strong>#2. Introduce the Solution</strong></p><p>Once you’ve connected with the pain of your target audience, you can introduce the solution that your product or service provides. This is where you talk about what your product or service can do for them.</p><p>For example, if you’re selling a weight loss product, you might want to talk about how your product can help them to lose weight and feel more confident.</p><p><strong>#3. Call to Action</strong></p><p>The last step in creating an effective Facebook ad is to include a call to action. This is where you tell the reader what you want them to do next. Do you want them to click on your ad, visit your website, or purchase your product? Make sure your call to action is clear and concise.</p><p>For example, if you want the reader to click on your ad, you might say something like “Click here to learn more about our weight loss product.”</p><p><strong>Example of Facebook ads Creative Image</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/creative-facebook-ads-example.jpg"                      alt="creative facebook ads example"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>Now that you know the three simple structures for creating a creative image for your Facebook Ads, it’s time to get started!

For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Here’s the step-by-step guide to doing that:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to your Facebook profile page and not the feed page. On your profile, scroll down a bit and click on the Music icon.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-music-track-from-facebook-profile.jpg"                      alt="delete Facebook Profile Music"                ></p><p>You can remove one song or multiple of them.</p><h2 id="Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile"><a href="#Part-5-Where-Can-I-Find-the-Music-Feature-on-Facebook-Profile" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?"></a>Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?</h2><p>If you are someone who likes to express yourself through music, then Facebook can let you do that efficiently.

You will be taken to the feed page first.

Since it’s your first time using the Music feature, the Music page will be blank.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the + icon that you see on the top right, and the music search window will appear. You can search for the songs you like to add to your profile here.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-feature.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Profile Music feature"                ></p><p>And that’s how the Music feature works on Facebook.</p><p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p><p>Music makes this world better, and we agree with that.

But if you are here on this page then probably you are going to break all rules now and are thinking to jump to Facebook platform with an eye catching profile. That’s a great idea. Facebook is available for free and its interactive user interface will make everything fun for you. I must add, this is the best platform to stay connected with all your near and dear ones.</p><p> So, follow these guidelines to get started with a new Facebook account.</p><h2 id="How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Account-1"><a href="#How-to-Create-a-Facebook-Account-1" class="headerlink" title="How to Create a Facebook Account"></a>How to Create a Facebook Account</h2><h4 id="Step-1-Sign-Up"><a href="#Step-1-Sign-Up" class="headerlink" title="Step 1.Sign Up"></a>Step 1.Sign Up</h4><p> The very first step is to open &lt;<a href="http://www.facebook.com>">www.facebook.com&gt;</a> on your web browser and then hit Create account option. It will ask for your basic information, simple add your real name in the space provided with two fields: First name and Last name. For the security reasons you may have to prove your identity so always prefer to create Facebook account with real name only.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-create-account.jpg"                      alt="facebook create account"                ></p><p> Then enter your accurate and working mobile number or users can also prefer to update their email ID.

Once the 24 hours timeline is over, your Facebook story is removed automatically. However, you may want to delete your Facebook story before it reaches the end of its timeline for a reason.
