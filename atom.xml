Hence, for capturing all six directions in a single footage you may require connecting 6 cameras together while adjusting their focus in different directions. The resultant content is known as 360 degree video. Many smart algorithms have been developed by professionals to get these videos stitched together to develop complete 360 degree content in a single footage. This is something like standing in the centre of a sphere and viewing everything in all directions.</p><p> These 360 degree videos have inspired the concept of virtual reality but these equipments are quite expensive. But as soon as the technology is gaining popularity, chances are to get VR gear at lower price in near future.</p><p> So, now you may be thinking hard that how this feature is useful for Facebook users. Actually, Facebook has recently enabled its users to upload 360 videos directly to their pages, groups or profiles so that audience can stay engaged.

Here’s Why"></a>Apple’s Vision Pro – A Must-Buy? Here’s Why</h2><p> The Vision Pro is Apple’s take on a VR headset like Meta’s Quest, HTC’s Vive, or the Valve Index. However, it’s a very different sort of device from those mentioned above, and it has a very different price, too. Accordingly, it can be a confusing product to judge.</p><p> In this article, we’ll explain what a Vision Pro is, who should buy it, who shouldn’t, and talk about the top four reasons why you might want to pick up Apple’s headset yourself.</p><h2 id="What-Is-an-Apple-Vision-Pro"><a href="#What-Is-an-Apple-Vision-Pro" class="headerlink" title="What Is an Apple Vision Pro?"></a>What Is an Apple Vision Pro?</h2><p> The Vision Pro is an<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/ar-vs-vr-vs-mr-vs-xr-7089737" >augmented&#x2F;virtual reality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> headset made by Apple. Pricing begins at $3,499, which is significantly more than other VR headsets like the $500 Meta Quest 3. Why’s it so much more?</p><p> Well, for one, it has a variety of incredibly high-end tech inside of it, like a Micro-OLED display with 23 million pixels (for reference, a 4K display has about 8.3 million pixels); Apple’s M2 chip, which has an eight-core CPU and a 10-core GPU; and an all-new, custom-designed R1 chip with low latency (12 ms).</p><p> It also has features that the world hasn’t seen before (or at least haven’t been executed as well before), like seamless hand and eye tracking, an external display that shows your eyes, realistic avatars, a 3D camera, and tons of integration with Mac and iPhone.</p><p>Justin Sullivan &#x2F; Getty Images</p><h2 id="Who-Should-Get-a-Vision-Pro"><a href="#Who-Should-Get-a-Vision-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Who Should Get a Vision Pro?"></a>Who Should Get a Vision Pro?</h2><p> Of course, folks interested in a next-gen AR&#x2F;VR headset might look into picking up this one. Beyond that, here are some reasons you might want to get a Vision Pro if:</p><ul><li>You want to see the most current tech</li><li>You use (or want) a multi-monitor setup at work.</li><li>You’re deeply ingrained in the Apple ecosystem.</li><li>An AR interface is more accessible for you.</li></ul><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/5-things-to-consider-before-buying-a-vr-headset-5271867" >5 Things to Consider Before Buying a VR Headset <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Who-Shouldn’t-Get-a-Vision-Pro"><a href="#Who-Shouldn’t-Get-a-Vision-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Who Shouldn’t Get a Vision Pro?"></a>Who Shouldn’t Get a Vision Pro?</h2><p> Nobody really “needs” a Vision Pro like they might need a laptop or a VR headset to play VR games, but you might not care:</p><ul><li>If you’re looking for a new VR headset to play games on</li><li>If you need a ton of bang for your buck</li><li>If replacing a laptop or iPad is a bigger priority</li></ul><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049379/7443" target="_top" id="2049379">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049379" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049379/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Why-You-Should-Buy-a-Vision-Pro"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Buy-a-Vision-Pro" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Buy a Vision Pro"></a>Why You Should Buy a Vision Pro</h2><p> Yes, it’s definitely cool, make no mistake. But beyond the basic appeal of Apple releasing a totally new, next-gen product, here’s why you should consider a Vision Pro.</p><p>Apple</p><h3 id="You-Want-to-See-the-Future-of-Headsets"><a href="#You-Want-to-See-the-Future-of-Headsets" class="headerlink" title="You Want to See the Future of Headsets"></a>You Want to See the Future of Headsets</h3><p> Much of what you see in the Vision Pro, like ultra high-resolution displays and advanced hand&#x2F;eye tracking, is likely to be cornerstone tech of VR headsets of the future.</p><p> If you want to be on the ground-floor for what’s to come and be an early adopter of some tech, the Vision Pro is a great device for you. Some of the tech powering the Vision Pro is nothing short of incredible, like its Micro-OLED displays that have more pixels-per-eye than iPhone 15 while being smaller at the same time.</p><p> For some, experiencing a major technological leap before years go by, the tech is refined, and everybody’s already used to it is a worthwhile experience in of itself.

A $500 VR headset like the Meta Quest 3 may be justifiable as a cool new gadget to play with, but a $3,499 headset is a lot harder to justify.</p><p> Another reason you might want to wait is that it doesn’t meet your needs at the moment. For example, if you’re interested in playing the latest VR games, the Vision Pro might not be the best option (it does play games, but VR-centric titles like_Beat Saber_ don’t currently have support).</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-gaming-phones-5179702" >Which iPhone Is Best for Gaming? <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> If you aren’t big on watching movies, and you don’t see much use for the multitasking and accessibility features of the Vision Pro, you might also give it a pass.</p><p> Lastly, if you aren’t a fan of the Apple ecosystem, own other Apple devices, or rely all that much on Apple features like iMessage or FaceTime, you may not get enough out of the Vision Pro to feel like you have all that much use for it.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-innovative-approaches-for-rising-through-the-rankings/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Innovative Approaches for Rising Through the Rankings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/new-mastering-mobile-vertical-panoramas-in-action/"><u>[New] Mastering Mobile Vertical Panoramas in Action</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-demystifying-the-purpose-what-is-a-blue-image-on-facebook-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Demystifying the Purpose What Is a Blue Image on Facebook for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-elevating-engagement-with-innovative-techniques-in-fb-lives-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Elevating Engagement with Innovative Techniques in FB Lives for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ace-your-fb-video-campaigns-with-these-powerful-tricks/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Ace Your FB Video Campaigns with These Powerful Tricks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-getting-involved-in-the-global-village-facebook/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Getting Involved in the Global Village (Facebook)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-navigating-snapads-a-business-strategy-guide/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Navigating SnapAds A Business Strategy Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://some-skills.techidaily.com/updated-streamlining-post-production-mastering-the-green-screen-process-kinemaster/"><u>[Updated] Streamlining Post-Production Mastering the Green Screen Process (KineMaster)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/updated-unleash-your-devices-potential-how-to-download-and-customize-whatsapp-ringtones-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Unleash Your Device's Potential How to Download and Customize WhatsApp Ringtones for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/2024-approved-leading-with-purpose-strategic-openings-in-podcasting/"><u>2024 Approved Leading with Purpose Strategic Openings in Podcasting</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-skills.techidaily.com/2024-approved-livestream-audiovideo-creators-hub/"><u>2024 Approved LiveStream Audio/Video Creators Hub</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/2024-approved-the-ultimate-selection-top-6-lite-video-downloaders-from-facebook/"><u>2024 Approved The Ultimate Selection Top 6 Lite Video Downloaders From Facebook</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/fb-video-downloader-pro-mp4-archive-now-available/"><u>FB Video Downloader Pro MP4 Archive Now Available</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/hacks-to-do-pokemon-go-trainer-battles-for-infinix-smart-7-hd-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Hacks to do pokemon go trainer battles For Infinix Smart 7 HD | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-latest-android-selection-ranked-top-10-apps-for-saving-facebook-videos/"><u>In 2024, Latest Android Selection Ranked Top 10 Apps for Saving Facebook Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-mac-techniques-for-capturing-your-minecraft-adventures/"><u>In 2024, Mac Techniques for Capturing Your Minecraft Adventures</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/rights-and-recourse-following-sudden-account-suspension-on-fb-for-2024/"><u>Rights and Recourse Following Sudden Account Suspension on FB for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

It had brought turbulence in the social media world back in 2004 which were embraced by everybody and it is carrying that charm until now! It is a social networking company registered under the name of ‘Facebook, Inc’ which allows its users to communicate with other people. These other people are also defined by users and can be their family, friends, coworkers or potential friends! Mark Zuckerberg, founder of Facebook created this boon of social media in 2004 while he was enrolled at Harvard University with a vision of designing a media platform for college students. But nobody would have imagined its progress graph! By 2006 anyone over the age of 13 with a valid email address could join Facebook. So this social networking website which was supposed to allow users to create profile, share moments through uploading photos and videos and assisted in staying in touch with family and friends for a long time, transformed into one of the much sought after platforms with more than 1 billion users worldwide.</p><p> Facebook is available in 37 different languages which truly reflect its respect towards diversity and it also supports various translation applications if you want to improve existing translation. Being the largest social media network was probably not enough for Facebook and hence the three key public features of Facebook which it has launched are classified as follows:</p><p><strong>Marketplace:</strong> It allows you to discover, buy and sell items in your community. You can post and respond to all sorts of ads of your region.</p><p><strong>Groups:</strong> It allows members to coordinate with near and far friends having common interests. The definition of common interests is open ended, it can be a bachelor party, concert bucket list or project updates, Facebook group lets you communicate in searchable place.</p><p><strong>Events:</strong> These encourage boosting engagement, get people talking, and provide helpful information and links for an upcoming event and ultimately planning and tracking who plans to attend. 650+ million users make use of Facebook Events and 100 million on an average every day to publicize the event!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/1995803/22899" target="_top" id="1995803">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-1995803" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/1995803/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know"><a href="#Common-Facebook-Terms-which-you-should-know" class="headerlink" title="Common Facebook Terms which you should know"></a>Common Facebook Terms which you should know</h2><p> If you haven’t joined Facebook until now and feel left out in the group of your friends when they discuss about liking and reacting to a post, updating status, hashtags and tagging then don’t worry! There are lots of terms and phrases which can be termed as ‘Language of Facebook’. These words were in dictionary earlier also but Facebook reinvented their purpose! Warning: They might seem confusing at first but once you enter this world, then these will become your prime words!</p><p><strong>Status Update:</strong> These are text based posts that can describe your mood, thoughts or anything which you want to share with your Facebook friends.</p><p><strong>Timeline:</strong> This is like a page dedicated to you (As good as your profile). You can share information including your pictures, basic information like your favorite books, entertainment shows, celebrity etc.</p><p><strong>News Feed:</strong> You can term it as combination of status and timeline of your friends. News Feed shows you updates from your friends and recent posts from the Facebook pages that you follow. This is where you spend your most of the time!</p><p><strong>Like:</strong> If you enjoyed and want to reach on the profiles of your friends then you choose to Like or Dislike the post.</p><p><strong>Tag:</strong> It is like marking your friends who hold relevance to the pictures or status that you are uploading on your timeline. These then appears on the timeline of your friends and in newsfeed of other friends.</p><p><strong>Notification:</strong> It is like an update from Facebook of the events and occasions where someone has interacted with you.

Here is a quick guide to Homepage and timeline:</p><h4 id="The-homepage"><a href="#The-homepage" class="headerlink" title="The homepage"></a>The homepage</h4><p> As soon as sign in to your Facebook account, you would be redirected to the News Feed. It means your homepage consists of information and images which your friends have shared. It consists of Menu at the very left which contains quick hyperlinks to Events, fun apps and groups that you are part of.</p><p> On the top right, there is a panel which shows notifications, new friends requests and chat messages. This whole section is termed as recent activity panel.</p><p> On the very top you would see a blank space reading like ‘What’s on your mind?’ This is the publisher space where you can update status or add pictures and videos that you would like to share.</p><p> News Feed as we discussed above is what your friends are sharing for you to see. Right panel which read as trending Stories highlights the posts which other are reading and you can click on those hyperlinks for detailed story if you are interested in them.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-homepage.jpg"                      alt=" facebook homepage "                ></p><h4 id="The-Timeline"><a href="#The-Timeline" class="headerlink" title="The Timeline"></a>The Timeline</h4><p> The Timeline which represents your profile and is visible to your friends and public (subject to your privacy settings) contains inventory of everything which you have shared and which people has tagged you.

While your conversations at email or IM’s are private, the content that you share on Facebook including photos and links are public. This is because Facebook has emerged as an open network for communication without any sort of limitations and is thus inclined towards being public although you can define privacy and sharing settings for some shared posts.</p><p> The privacy tools can be applied on few posts and information, the remaining information (such as your cover picture) is visible to everybody. Facebook is designed to be more open and social than traditional communication tools.

Many companies ignore the cover photo and put up some generic, unfocused image. It is a mistake.</p><p>The cover photo takes up a lot of room on your Facebook page, even more room than your profile picture. It should be an image that is attractive, engaging and in keeping with the brand image that you are trying to create around your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-great-cover-photo.JPG"                      alt="facebook cover photo"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://25home.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148649/16836" target="_top" id="2148649">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16836-2148649" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="720" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://25home.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148649/16836"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="4-Optimize-Your-“About”-Page"><a href="#4-Optimize-Your-“About”-Page" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Your “About” Page"></a>4. Optimize Your “About” Page</h3><p>One of the most useful Facebook tips for business is to optimize the About section of your business page. When someone first arrives on your page and they are curious about your business, they will go to the About section to get more information.</p><p>There is also a small preview of the page that appears on your home page. It will show nuggets of information, which you can customize to include the most useful details. Your full page should describe the business and mention vital details like your location, hours, website, phone number and more.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/about-page-facebook.JPG"                      alt="facebook about page"                ></p><h3 id="5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button"><a href="#5-Add-a-Call-to-Action-Button" class="headerlink" title="5. Add a Call to Action Button"></a>5. Add a Call to Action Button</h3><p>A few years ago, Facebook added a feature that let you include a call to action on your page. For instance, you can ask someone to sign up to a mailing list, watch a video, visit your website or play a game. These calls to action are handy at moving someone from your page to another site where they can continue to learn about your company.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="facebook call to action"                ></p><p><strong>You may also like:</strong> <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Facebook Jail: 10 Secrets to Avoid Being Blocked &#x2F; Get Out of It &gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134500/19576" target="_top" id="2134500">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2134500" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="600" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134500/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals"><a href="#Part-3-Facebook-Marketing-Tips-For-Professionals" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals"></a>Part 3: Facebook Marketing Tips For Professionals</h2><h3 id="6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top"><a href="#6-Pin-a-Unique-or-Important-Post-to-the-Top" class="headerlink" title="6.

Pin a Unique or Important Post to the Top</h3><p>Much like you can do on Twitter, it is possible to pin a useful or relevant post to the top of your page. Say it is a post that went viral and you want others who come on your page to learn about it. You could place that post on the top by pinning it there, even if you have newer posts.</p><h3 id="7-Share-Unique-Content"><a href="#7-Share-Unique-Content" class="headerlink" title="7. Share Unique Content"></a>7. Share Unique Content</h3><p>Companies fall into the trap of just posting self-promoting links to their site or other social media channels.

Each one aims to help you reach your goal - whether that’s video views, leading people to your website, or getting them to buy your product. Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.</p><p>You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad won’t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client. Once you’ve got that out the way, you can look at doing the actual creation work.</p><h4 id="2-Choosing-A-Format"><a href="#2-Choosing-A-Format" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing A Format"></a>2. Choosing A Format</h4><p>Once you’ve gone through the initial info, you need to choose a format for your ad.

Here, we’ll choose Single Image or Video format to show the next steps. Once you’ve got the hang of it, you can experiment with the other two.</p><h4 id="3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements"><a href="#3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3.

Click Add Image and a window will open for you to select images - you can choose from the images on your account, your particular Facebook page you’re creating the ad for, your Instagram, or upload stock images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-assets.jpg"                      alt="add Facebook ads image assets "                ></p><p>When adding images to media, remember to choose images that are the same size and orientation.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2049383/7443" target="_top" id="2049383">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2049383" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2049383/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Bonus-Why-you-should-place-Video-Ads-on-Facebook"><a href="#Bonus-Why-you-should-place-Video-Ads-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?"></a>Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?</h3><p>As we said before, Facebook has billions daily users, and here are just a few reasons to start using this as a platform to get your videos out there:</p><ul><li>Facebook is regarded as the most important network for marketers, beating LinkedIn by a whopping 46%</li><li>Facebook video get, on average, over <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/" >8 billion daily views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Viewers are 1.5 times more likely to watch video on smartphones than on a computer</li><li>Video makes up just 3% of the content on Facebook, but has the highest engagement rate</li></ul><p>No matter what your business, video is a tool you should be taking advantage of, and with stats like these, Facebook is a great place to start getting your video ads out there!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1982459">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1982459">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1982459.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1982459%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1982459/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="What-Could-You-Use-the-Creation-Kit-For"><a href="#What-Could-You-Use-the-Creation-Kit-For" class="headerlink" title="What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?"></a>What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?</h3><p>Whatever the purpose of your video, you’ll find the Facebook Video Creation Kit to be quite useful for you.

These photos tell viewers to move their phone around to get details about surroundings. The trend of sharing regular photos on Facebook has gone now and future is all about 360 content.</p><p> As we all know that 360 photos or videos are captured from special cameras that have 360 degree capability. So, most of you might be thinking that you may need to spend a lot to stay tuned to this feature on your device. But the truth is that you need not to buy any expensive camera unit to produce 360 photos for your Facebook post. It doesn’t even require a special 360 degree app to upload interactive pictures.</p><p> Probably you have a tablet or phone that support Facebook live 360 video feature. Actually as per the recent announcement made by Facebook professionals regarding its updated applications, live 360 is compatible with all devices launched after iPad Pro. iPad Air, iPad Mini 2 or iPhone 4S models. Till now Facebook has not revealed any news related to compatibility of new features over Android devices and chances are that Android users need to wait so long to enjoy this feature on their device. However, they made a useful statement that Galaxy devices launched after Galaxy Note 3 and Galaxy S5 will support this feature.</p><h2 id="Taking-360-Photos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-With-Built-in-Camera-App"><a href="#Taking-360-Photos-on-iPhone-and-iPad-With-Built-in-Camera-App" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 Photos on iPhone and iPad With Built in Camera App"></a>Taking 360 Photos on iPhone and iPad With Built in Camera App</h2><p> Generally 360 degree camera is most preferable choice for developing high quality 360 degree images but in case if you don’t have one then Panorama feature of built in device cameras can make it possible. However, users cannot get focus from up and down but they can at least pan from right to left by simply swiping on their display. This feature only works for photos that mean you cannot develop 360 videos using Panorama.</p><p> If you are using iPad or iPhone then simple open your camera app and go to Panorama Shooting mode. Start capturing your photo with panoramic photo option but note that you have to follow Facebook photo dimension specifications to develop a live 360 compatible content. However, it is really hard to measure exact dimensions of a panoramic photo when you are working with default settings.</p><p> As soon as you have captured your desired shot, move to your Facebook account and browse photo library. Choose your recently captured panorama photo and then follow instructions provided on screen to update your video. You can also preview your content, now add desired caption and publish your content online. Soon your will start receiving interesting comments and reviews from audience. Users can also delete their 360 degree photos after few hours as per their need. Such types of videos are being commonly used for entertainment and marketing purpose throughout the world.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2044582/7443" target="_top" id="2044582">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2044582" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2044582/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Taking-360-Photos-on-Android-Smartphone-with-Google-Street-View"><a href="#Taking-360-Photos-on-Android-Smartphone-with-Google-Street-View" class="headerlink" title="Taking 360 Photos on Android Smartphone with Google Street View"></a>Taking 360 Photos on Android Smartphone with Google Street View</h2><p> It is important to capture 360 degree photos in Facebook compatible formats so professionals recommend using Google’s street view camera app for this purpose. It works fine over iOS as well as Android platform and let users enjoy unlimited 360 shoots. To develop 360 degree videos from this application:</p><ul><li>First of all get it installed on your device. You will find a plus sign on your app window, hit this and then select Open Camera option. This app can provide you complete guidelines about how to capture 360 degree images. Note that users need to keep their camera still while capturing such shots.</li><li>Try to move your phone around till the time you notice orange dots on screen. As soon as these dots are there, photos will be captured automatically.

The fact is the when sensor of a DSLR camera stays ON for long time, it suffers huge damage. Open shutter leads to potential harm to your camera. It is good to use DSLR for short while but if you are a beginner and need a device to begin with then prefer to pick right webcam for your needs.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                ></a><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/richard-bennett.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135414/19272" target="_top" id="2135414">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135414" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135414/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Richard Bennett</p><p>Richard Bennett is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Richard Bennett</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-basic-to-brilliant-top-100plus-biographies-that-captivate-audiences/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Basic to Brilliant Top 100+ Biographies that Captivate Audiences</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-ghostly-witness-to-fb-vignettes/"><u>[New] In 2024, Ghostly Witness to Fb Vignettes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-most-popular-fb-videos-download-now/"><u>[New] In 2024, Most Popular FB Videos - Download Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-discover-5-premier-apps-for-effortless-download-of-videos-and-sounds-from-fb/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Discover 5 Premier Apps for Effortless Download of Videos and Sounds From FB</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-essential-game-editor-tools-for-novices/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Essential Game Editor Tools for Novices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-profiling-success-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Profiling Success A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/in-2024-4-methods-to-turn-off-life-360-on-asus-rog-phone-7-ultimate-without-anyone-knowing-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>In 2024, 4 Methods to Turn off Life 360 On Asus ROG Phone 7 Ultimate without Anyone Knowing | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/24-a-step-by-step-journey-through-high-impact-youtube-banner-designs/"><u>In 2024, A Step-by-Step Journey Through High-Impact YouTube Banner Designs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/in-2024-unveiling-the-art-of-facebook-reels-production/"><u>In 2024, Unveiling the Art of Facebook Reels Production</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/shoes-for-virtual-ground-leading-treadmill-insights/"><u>Shoes for Virtual Ground Leading Treadmill Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-4-big-no-nos-sidestepping-errors-when-deploying-chatgpt-for-your-blogging-needs/"><u>The 4 Big No-Nos: Sidestepping Errors When Deploying ChatGPT for Your Blogging Needs</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-content.techidaily.com/unlocking-top-five-transformative-facebook-traits/"><u>Unlocking Top Five Transformative Facebook Traits</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-apps.techidaily.com/updated-top-video-blur-effects-apps-for-mobile-devices/"><u>Updated Top Video Blur Effects Apps for Mobile Devices</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

You have to find the right type of content that people will share with their friends. We all know that some posts are more likely than others to get shared on social media—but what makes them so clickable? Well, there are several different types of Facebook-ready material out there in the world:</p><h2 id="Contests-and-Giveaways"><a href="#Contests-and-Giveaways" class="headerlink" title="Contests and Giveaways"></a>Contests and Giveaways</h2><p>Contests and giveaways are a great way to get people to engage with your page. While it’s important to make sure that the contest is fun, easy, and not too much work for you, you should also think about what kind of prizes would be relevant and interesting to people who visit your page.</p><p>Remember: giveaways should be something people want! A good prize will help attract more participation in the contest and create buzz around your brand.</p><p>Contest Alert from Enchanted Kingdom is the perfect Facebook contest idea to generate excitement for their upcoming events.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137975/21526" target="_top" id="2137975">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/21526-2137975" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://zebaoaffiliateprogram.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137975/21526"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Your-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Life Events"></a>Your Life Events</h2><p>As a business owner, you want to create a buzz on Facebook. You’ve tried posting ads and boosting posts, but that doesn’t seem to be working for you. The answer is simple: post about your life events!</p><p>You don’t have to be an attendee of someone else’s wedding or send out birth announcements every time one of your family members gives birth; however, if you have something exciting going on in your life (or even just funny stories) there are plenty of opportunities for viral content.</p><p>These types of posts can really boost the engagement on your page because they show off the human side of being a business owner—you’re not just posting about how great your services are; people get excited when they see that their favorite barista had a baby or experienced some kind of major success in life.</p><p>A great example of a life event post is when Mark Zuckerberg’s post is coming baby with Priscilla Chan. When Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and Priscilla Chan are going to have a baby, the reaction from the audience ranged anywhere between congratulations and excitement for their future kid. The post has since gone viral with over 1.3 reactions!</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2105859/7443" target="_top" id="2105859">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2105859" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2105859/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Your-Company’s-Life-Events"><a href="#Your-Company’s-Life-Events" class="headerlink" title="Your Company’s Life Events"></a>Your Company’s Life Events</h2><ul><li>Share milestones and achievements. This is one of the easiest ways to create a buzz on Facebook. No matter if you’re celebrating a major accomplishment or simply adding a new employee to your team, highlight it! Has some sort of contest or giveaway that encourages fans to join in on the celebration (i.e., “Like this post if you want us to throw you a party”).</li><li>Share news about your company. Stay connected with customers by sharing news and updates regarding your company, products, services, and more – especially if they are relevant to what people are talking about in their social networks at that time (i.e., Trending Topics). For example: “Want a sneak peek at our upcoming product launch? Click here.” If there’s something going on in your industry that’s creating buzz throughout social networks, be sure not only to talk about it but also show how it relates back to what makes your business special&#x2F;different from everyone else out there!</li></ul><p>Take a look at Ford’s post about their Media’s Awards Choice in the years 2020-2021. It features the Ford Ranger and Ford Mustang.

While you may not be able to get in on the actual celebrations, you can still use the holidays and seasonal content to your advantage. For example, if it’s Halloween time, consider posting pictures from last year’s party! People love nostalgia and will share those posts with their friends in no time.</li><li>Create a holiday giveaway or contest. Customers love free stuff! Create a competition that includes everyone; even if someone does not win anything valuable (although this is always appreciated), they will still feel appreciated for joining your page because they were given the chance at receiving something nice as well as help out their favorite business by spreading awareness about it through social media sharing of their own.</li></ul><p>Check this Mother’s Day post from Mason Cash with their mechanics of Like, Follow &amp; comment to win a Mother’s Day bundle worth over $75.</p><h2 id="Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist"><a href="#Classic-Photos-with-a-Twist" class="headerlink" title="Classic Photos with a Twist"></a>Classic Photos with a Twist</h2><p>One way to get your photo on the front page of Facebook is with a classic picture. But you can’t just post any old photo and hope for the best. You need to make sure that the image looks as good as possible, and it needs to be relevant to your business or brand.</p><p>While most people think of their feed as a place where they’ll see pictures of friends and family, there are plenty of opportunities here for businesses too—if they know what they’re doing. A good caption will also help keep your audience engaged by adding value to the photo; don’t go overboard with hashtags though, because that’s one way of making it harder for people who aren’t following you yet (or who have never heard of you) from finding this information later on down the line when they decide whether or not they want something from your store&#x2F;organization&#x2F;etcetera.”</p><p>The photo of this simple yet creative picture with 308 reactions, 55 comments, and 13 shares from Lenovo is one among many examples of a classic photo with a twist post.</p><h2 id="Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos"><a href="#Photos-of-Animals-Bonus-points-for-videos" class="headerlink" title="Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)"></a>Photos of Animals (Bonus points for videos)</h2><p>Photos of animals are the most popular content on Facebook and for good reason. They’re cute! They’re funny! And they make you feel things—maybe even happy or inspired. In other words, they’re relatable in a way that other posts aren’t.</p><p>There’s also the fact that photos of animals can be used to promote your brand in subtle ways. For example, if you have an animal-related product or business (cat food company), then including cats in your photos will attract cat lovers who might not otherwise follow you on social media.</p><p>Check out one of the amazing Subaru of America, Inc. commercials featuring one of Golden Meadows puppies, Amber, learning how to parallel park!</p><h2 id="Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring"><a href="#Facebook-content-that-goes-viral-is-either-fun-or-inspiring" class="headerlink" title="Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring"></a>Facebook content that goes viral is either fun or inspiring</h2><p>The best way to get likes, comments, and shares on your Facebook page is by posting high-quality content that people will want to share with their friends. The reason why a post goes viral on Facebook is that it’s either informative or entertaining.</p><ul><li>For inspiration: Post something that motivates the reader and makes them feel good about themselves or their life situation. You can do this in many ways such as sharing quotes from famous people, funny videos or photos, etc.</li><li>For fun: Post things that make the readers laugh like funny photos, memes or cartoons&#x2F;drawings of characters from popular movies&#x2F;cartoon series like Pokemon Go! Which has become a global phenomenon!</li></ul><p><strong>BONUS:</strong> Wondershare Filmora can help you to create stunning videos that can go viral.</p><p>With <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, anyone can create stunning videos that are sure to capture the attention of the online world.
