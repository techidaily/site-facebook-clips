Being dragged through the media mud inspired the company to return to its cores and to offer a unique social media experience for all of its users once more. At the beginning of 2018, it became possible for the first time to <strong>record video calls on Facebook</strong> from an iPhone or iPad that has an iOS.11 or later version of the operating system installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-facebook-video-calls.jpg"                      alt="record facebook video calls"                ></p><p>Facebook was also one of the first social media networks that started offering the live video call option back in 2011. In this article, we are going to provide screen recording solutions for Facebook video call and chat recording on different platforms, including Windows, Mac, Android, and iOS platforms, and we’ll show you how you can easily record video calls on Facebook.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Method 2: Record Facebook Video Call on iPhone or iPad</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android devices</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</a></li></ul><h2 id="Method-1-The-Best-Way-to-Capture-Video-Calls-on-Mac-and-Windows-OS"><a href="#Method-1-The-Best-Way-to-Capture-Video-Calls-on-Mac-and-Windows-OS" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS"></a>Method 1: The Best Way to Capture Video Calls on Mac and Windows OS</h2><p>There are many different ways to record a Facebook video call on a <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Macbook <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or PC, but only a few of them are more efficient than using <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmora Screen Video Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Wondershare’s full-featured software provides a quick and easy way to record all your desktop activities in HD, even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K video quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it also features a video editing mode where you can brush up your videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Filmora can record videos via the built-in or an external webcam record system audio and audio from an external source, which means you record videos using professional equipment. You can start a new screen recording session by clicking on the software’s desktop icon and selecting the Quick Capture mode from the software’s welcome window. Before each session, you should choose the area of the screen you want to record, change the video’s frame rate, and choose the video and audio capturing devices. After you’ve adjusted the settings for the screen recording session, you can start a video call on Facebook and then hit the Record button to start capturing the video.</p><p>Pause or stop recording at any moment by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the software’s toolbar or by using the Hotkey F10. Once the session is complete, the video file you’ve created will be opened in Filmora video editing mode. The software’s video editor offers transitions, cutting, and trimming tools, as well as a rich selection of annotations, filters, and effects. Filmora video editor supports nearly all popular input video file formats, but you can only export Facebook video calls as MP4 or MOV files. The software also enables you to capture videos on <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Instagram <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Even though the devices that run on iOS 11 operating systems can record Facebook video calls, in theory, this feature has been inactive recently. The feature functions sporadically even on the iOS 13 version of the operating system. The App Store doesn’t offer too many choices for capturing screens on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>When you install the app on your device, you should enable the Mirroring option in the AirPlay app to project the screen of your iPhone to a computer. Then proceed to make a video call on Facebook and hit the record button displayed on the top of the screen you projected from your phone. The Appersoft app offers support for MP4, FLV, or GIF files, and it can capture footage in 1080p and 720p video resolution. You won’t be able to edit your videos with Appersoft, but the App Store offers a lot of great video editing apps at reasonable prices.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices"></a>Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices</h2><p>The Google Play Store provides a wide range of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and most of them feature enough screen recording tools to enable you to record a video call on Facebook. <strong>DU Recorder</strong> is one of the best options at your disposal because it is completely free and contains no in-app purchases.</p><p>The app lets you adjust frame rates, capture HD videos, and control the video recording settings from the notifications bar. The phone’s front camera can be used to record yourself speaking during the video call on Facebook, and you can also record external sound with the app. Du Recorder offers an alternative storage option that enables you to store Facebook video call recordings in your chosen location.</p><p>Besides being a powerful tool for capturing a screen of an Android device, this versatile app also offers video editing and live streaming services. The Du Recorder’s screen capturing mode can also produce GIF files, which can produce popular social media content.</p><h2 id="Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger"><a href="#Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger"></a>Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-videos-with-fb-messenger.jpg"                      alt="record videos with facebook messenger"                ></p><p>Android users can record all of their video calls from the Facebook Messenger app. You can start recording a video by launching the app and selecting the contact from the People With Messenger list in the Messanger tab. After you’ve selected the contact to whom the video will be sent, you should tap on the Camera button, located near the bottom of the screen, and then place your finger on the ‘Hold send button for video, tap for photo’ button and hold it there while recording the video. The video recording will stop once you lift your finger up and the video will be automatically sent to the contact you selected.</p><p>Using this method, a video captured with Facebook Messenger will not be saved on your Android phone, but you can change this setting and save all your Facebook video calls on your device’s SD card. Tap on your profile picture in the Facebook Messenger app, and find the ‘Photos, Videos, and Emoji’ menu.</p><p>The ‘Download Videos’ option in the ‘Photos, Videos and Emoji’ tab will be set on Wi-Fi Only by default, and you can activate the video download feature simply by tapping on the ON option in the ‘Download Videos’ window. You can disable this option whenever you want if the videos take too much of your phone’s memory by tapping on the OFF button, but the videos you download will play much smoother than the ones stored on the cloud.</p><h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Though it is convenient to record the Facebook video calls and chats, we recommend you inform the one who is calling you before recording the video.

However, <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/zuck/posts/10104413015393571" >the announcemetn of Mark Zuckerberg <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook algorithm will focus on meaningful interactions, resulted in marketers more worrying about their ability to reach a targeted audience in 2024.</p><p>There is also concern about how the <a class="link"   href="https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/01/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together/" >Facebook algorithm change <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> would impact the ability of businesses to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >work with influencers on the platform <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. The changes are geared towards showing people more content from friends and family, instead of business posts, so the changes in 2024 are so much different than previous changes.</p><p>In this case, it is much more important to know the Facebook algorithm change for marketers in 2024.

The basic meaning is that Facebook cares more about user spending quality on Facebook, rather than just focus on time. Traditionally, time spent is a key factor to measure Facebook’s growth, which results in increasing users’ spending time with all efforts. Now, things are changed. Facebook algorithm decides sharing and commenting are the symbols of meaningful interactions, meaning that Facebook wants you interact with friends. Randomly click likes on a photo, article or video are no longer positive signal to algorithm.</p><p>There <a class="link"   href="https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/new-facebook-algorithm-26-friends/" >once comes a rumor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that Facebook will only show 26 friends in feed, which is false. In fact, Facebook algorithm is broken down into four components. There is <strong>inventory</strong>, <strong>signals</strong>, <strong>predictions</strong> and the <strong>overall score</strong>. Signals are the considerations about content. And it is signals that marketers and businesses must focus on when they are promoting content through the Facebook news feed.</p><p>Signals include the average time spent on content, when it’s posted, the type of story, how many comments or likes it gets, and how often it is shared on the news feed or through Messenger.</p><p>The idea is that Facebook will promote content that gets more engagement, because those are the posts likely to come from family and friends. It is up to marketers to ensure their content is similarly personal and conversation-worthy!</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: if you want to get a higher ranking in Facebook feed, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >creating square videos <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is an important method.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors"><a href="#Part-2-Four-Top-Facebook-Algorithm-Ranking-Factors" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors"></a>Part 2: Four Top Facebook Algorithm Ranking Factors</h2><p>When it comes to how content is ordered and presented on the Facebook news feed, there are four factors that go into the process. These ranking factors include comments, sharing, reactions and engagement. We explore each factor in depth below:</p><h3 id="1-Comments"><a href="#1-Comments" class="headerlink" title="1. Comments"></a>1. Comments</h3><p>When people or businesses make posts that no one reacts to - those posts are going to be shown a lot less in a person’s feed. Pages that promote conversation and get a lot of engagement will see a significant rise.</p><p>Brands must work on content that is getting people to comment and then converse with each other through the comment chain. It can be a focus on timely and relevant topics, which will get people talking immediately!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="facebook algorithm change comment 2019"                ></p><h3 id="2-Sharing"><a href="#2-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="2. Sharing"></a>2. Sharing</h3><p>Did you know that when <a class="link"   href="https://www.dailydot.com/debug/facebook-messenger-link-urls-security/" >a link is shared on Messenger <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> by Facebook users, it has an impact on how that post appears on the feed? Facebook cares about the interactions that people have through the content posted on the site. And that means a focus on content that is shared through Messenger.</p><p>Say a company makes a post that many followers enjoy. They like and&#x2F;or comment on the post. But they also copy the link and share it with friends through Messenger, instead of sharing it publicly on their feed.</p><p>Such shares are just as important as the public sharing. Many companies would focus on the public aspect with previous content. But now they can focus on getting people to share articles through the private chats on Messenger.</p><h3 id="3-Reactions"><a href="#3-Reactions" class="headerlink" title="3. Reactions"></a>3. Reactions</h3><p>People having a reaction to your content is increasingly important. When someone reacts to the comment through the available emojis, the post will be higher up in many followers’ feeds.</p><p>What also matters is the type of reaction they are having. It is said that when someone clicks on the love icon, it has a slightly better impact through the algorithm as compared to the like icon.</p><p>Facebook wants to see people having active and unique reactions to the post. Even the Wow, Sad, Angry and Haha icons have a <a class="link"   href="https://buffer.com/resources/facebook-reactions" >more positive result as compared to the simple likes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-algorithm-change-reaction.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change Reactions"                ></p><h3 id="4-Engagement"><a href="#4-Engagement" class="headerlink" title="4. Engagement"></a>4. Engagement</h3><p>Facebook is going one step further when it comes to the engagement triggers on the algorithm. In the past, having the post shared by different users was enough to see it get a positive bump in the algorithm.</p><p>While those shares are still helpful, the impact is a bit less. What is really needed is a reaction on the shares of your followers.</p><p>Say your company makes a post and it is shared by 50 people. If there are many reactions to the followers of those 50 people when they shared your post, the original post will see a significant bump through the algorithm.</p><h2 id="Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers"><a href="#Part-3-What-Does-An-Algorithm-Change-Mean-For-Marketers" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers"></a>Part 3: What Does An Algorithm Change Mean For Marketers</h2><p>The Facebook algorithm changes mean that it will be more challenging to reach people with posts that are made by businesses.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/news/news-feed-fyi-bringing-people-closer-together" >Companies will need a very engaged audience <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> if they want to gain traction on the feed through organic means. And that means posts that are shared, commented on, reacted to and more popular with the Facebook audience. Some pages will start posting something irrelevant with their business. But it is always important to build powerful content like Facebook says.</p><h2 id="Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm"><a href="#Part-4-6-Solutions-to-Adjust-to-the-Facebook-Algorithm" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm"></a>Part 4: 6 Solutions to Adjust to the Facebook Algorithm</h2><h3 id="1-Pay-attention-to-video"><a href="#1-Pay-attention-to-video" class="headerlink" title="1. Pay attention to video"></a>1. Pay attention to video</h3><p>Videos tend to attract engagement naturally if the video is good enough. However, have you ever considered live video? Facebook official said live video gets 6 times interactions than regular videos. It is true. In this Facebook algorithm change, <a class="link"   href="https://www.socialmediaexaminer.com/facebook-live-why-live-video-matters-for-marketers/" >live video matters <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. More and more business owners try the new field - live video and they did pretty good. If you haven’t invest live video, now you should start looking for this new method to boost comments and shares.</p><p>Just like Facebook did in May 2. It showed Mark’s opening keynote on Facebook’s latest technology and innovation. Now, this live video has gained more than 1 thousand comments and shares. If you want to make Facebook videos, <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >check Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It includes various titles&#x2F;text templates, visual effects and audio to make your marketing video perfect.</p><h3 id="2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities"><a href="#2-Create-Engagement-Opportunities" class="headerlink" title="2. Create Engagement Opportunities"></a>2. Create Engagement Opportunities</h3><p>When people have more conversations on your posts, it means those posts are going to be higher up on the feed. Facebook cares about the interactions people are having with content, as they want them to spend more time on the platform.</p><p>Companies often use Facebook to put out basic news stories about the company, new products or discounts. While these posts are interesting, they are not exactly conversation starters. It will be up to businesses to ensure they are creating content that can help people have more meaningful conversations on the platform.</p><p>Sharing news stories that are related to the industry is one way to do this. A company does not always have to promote its own business through Facebook posts. Sharing opinions on changes in an industry that your followers care about is a good way to boost engagement levels, so making engagement opportunities is a great method to rely to Facebook algorithm change.</p><h3 id="3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups"><a href="#3-Leverage-Facebook-Groups" class="headerlink" title="3. Leverage Facebook Groups"></a>3. Leverage Facebook Groups</h3><p>Did you know that around <a class="link"   href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2016/01/27/facebook-groups-reaches-1-billion-users/79414710/" >1 billion people use Facebook Groups <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>? And around 100 million people say that when they are on Facebook, they are primarily using Groups to interact with other people and content.</p><p>Groups are the perfect way to build a community that is active and interested in specific topics. If a business can create groups that are targeting a community, niche or a segment of the market, it will help them boost engagement levels. Posts that are shared within those groups will see a lot of engagement, as they are filled with users who care about the content.</p><p>The impact will not only be felt in rising engagement within those groups, but in the way those posts are ranked in the general feed as well.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-groups.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads"><a href="#4-Limit-Focus-on-Facebook-Ads" class="headerlink" title="4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads"></a>4. Limit Focus on Facebook Ads</h3><p>The changes that Facebook has made to its algorithm were done with the company’s future in mind. Facebook wants to make more money and fuel growth. They do not want a user base that is rarely checking the platform or interacting with content.</p><p>The best advice that we can give to marketers and business owners is to ignore Facebook ads. The company has made changes so that you will turn to ads and simply pay to get your posts to the top of the feed.</p><p>But that does not have to be the case. You can completely ignore ads and focus on the organic efforts that we have mentioned above. Those will get you the higher levels of engagement that you need to remain relevant with the new algorithm. But you can still <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >make ads by Facebook video editors <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/facebook-ads.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change 2019"                ></p><h3 id="5-Stick-to-strong-content"><a href="#5-Stick-to-strong-content" class="headerlink" title="5. Stick to strong content"></a>5. Stick to strong content</h3><p>It is understandable for companies to feel as though a scary change has taken place on Facebook. The way that posts are prioritized in the feed is different to what it was before. Facebook claims it is all about getting family and friend posts closer to the top of the feed.</p><p>But like any algorithm change, marketers can react to ensure the content they are promoting is being seen by as many people as possible. <a class="link"   href="https://www.naturettl.com/upload-photos-facebook-best-quality-possible/" >Improving engagement and promoting conversation-worthy content <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can help make that happen.</p><h3 id="6-Try-Facebook-influencer"><a href="#6-Try-Facebook-influencer" class="headerlink" title="6. Try Facebook influencer"></a>6. Try Facebook influencer</h3><p>Have you experienced posting a image without any engagement, even likes? If it happens, you should change your posting strategy. Today, Facebook influencer is showing powerful influencing ability. You should look for an influencer who has the same audience you want and are willing to interact with your brand. However, you should be aware of some influencers might have fake fans to get likes. As in this new Facebook algorithm change, likes are not the most essential factor, so you need to <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >distinguish the fake fans and real fans <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/algorithm-change-on-facebook-influencer.jpg"                      alt="facebook algorithm change influencer"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>We hope this guide will help any business or marketer that is looking to use Facebook for promotional purposes in 2024.

But, they are unaware of the significance of Facebook SEO and what potential it has for their brand enhancement. If the SEO for your Facebook page is done right, your brand’s Google rankings would move a notch higher. This in turn will <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >attract more influencers <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> organically to find you. If you are unsure about the entire process of implementing SEO for Facebook, then here is a quick peek through.</p><p> In this article, we are going to introduce you the significant aspects and ways for enhancing the Facebook SEO strategy for your brand.</p><h2 id="How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO"><a href="#How-to-optimize-Facebook-SEO" class="headerlink" title="How to optimize Facebook SEO"></a>How to optimize Facebook SEO</h2><h3 id="1-Optimize-Facebook-Content"><a href="#1-Optimize-Facebook-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Optimize Facebook Content"></a>1. Optimize Facebook Content</h3><p> Speaking of SEO for Facebook page, though, it might not have a direct impact on social media content and popup results for your keyword search on Google. You need to mention the social media platform name in Google search to get the results. Your content will be easily discoverable by users when you <a class="link"   href="https://www.wordstream.com/articles/keyword-research-for-social-media-guide" >optimize social media content using keywords <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Links and public posts using those keywords will show up on the search results.</p><p> People click and engage with your content if it’s relevant to them and included in the keywords, and spend more time on your site.</p><h3 id="2-Optimize-Page-URL"><a href="#2-Optimize-Page-URL" class="headerlink" title="2. Optimize Page URL"></a>2. Optimize Page URL</h3><p> For Facebook SEO, you need to have a <a class="link"   href="https://www.weebly.com/seo/url" >custom URL same as your brand name <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. It eventually promotes brand recognition and makes users remember your brand. Unless you create a custom URL for your Facebook page, Facebook might auto-generate a long and tough to memorize URL. Using ‘Page Info’ under your Facebook page’s ‘About’ section, access the ‘Create Page @username’ and create the username. Set the brand name in place of username and you are good to go.</p><h3 id="3-Optimize-company-profile"><a href="#3-Optimize-company-profile" class="headerlink" title="3. Optimize company profile"></a>3. Optimize company profile</h3><p> While doing SEO for Facebook page, not every brand optimizes their company profile online. But, it is crucial to optimize and encourage growth of the Facebook fan page for their brands. When you add phone numbers and address on your business page, Google gives more credibility to your page. As a result, your brand’s overall SEO will be enhanced.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile.JPG"                      alt="facebook profile"                ></p><h3 id="4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes"><a href="#4-Optimize-Facebook-Notes" class="headerlink" title="4. Optimize Facebook Notes"></a>4. Optimize Facebook Notes</h3><p> Facebook Notes are utilized to create engagement and inform your fans about important business related news, current crisis or upcoming events. These Notes get indexed post search by Google for business profile only. Through them, you can add keyword rich content and improve the fan page ranks in Google and Bing. Photos as well as the title and Note contain keywords within the caption. After adding captions to your Notes, if users comment in it, then the chances to rank higher increases. If the comments too have keywords as well, the Notes gains more value, attracting engagement and tags.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/note-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Optimize Facebook Notes"                ></p><h3 id="5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page"><a href="#5-Add-Backlink-to-your-fan-page" class="headerlink" title="5. Add Backlink to your fan page"></a>5. Add Backlink to your fan page</h3><p> Facebook SEO requires inbound links to your page, in order to improvise the authoritativeness of your page as per Google for high ranking. Always <a class="link"   href="https://smallbusiness.chron.com/external-facebook-fan-30204.html" >include a link to your fan page <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from digital channels like blog, website, Twitter profile to your Facebook page.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-backlink-facebook.JPG"                      alt="Add Backlink to your fan page"                ></p><h3 id="6-Post-Fresh-Content"><a href="#6-Post-Fresh-Content" class="headerlink" title="6. Post Fresh Content"></a>6. Post Fresh Content</h3><p> Fresh, keyword optimized, quality content is important for social media as well as website pages for any brand. It applies to Facebook equally. Unique content helps your brand rank better, but at times you run out of content ideas. Using influencer marketing, you can add fresh content with a new tone to your content marketing drives. Guest posts, product review, and campaigns on social media takeover can help your business to a great extent. Influencers propel their followers for creating unique content for your business. Through hashtags, they might ask their followers to tag them and your brand as well in social media campaigns or share their experiences.</p><h3 id="7-Make-Business-time-Accurate"><a href="#7-Make-Business-time-Accurate" class="headerlink" title="7. Make Business time Accurate"></a>7. Make Business time Accurate</h3><p> Mentioning the business times on your Facebook page is important. In case it changes, you need to immediately update it. Moreover, new location page additions along with correct operational hours and days should be mentioned too. Facebook doesn’t have the feature to allow you customizing hours for special events or holidays, but you can use Facebook posts and advertising to meet that need.</p><h3 id="8-Optimize-featured-Image"><a href="#8-Optimize-featured-Image" class="headerlink" title="8. Optimize featured Image"></a>8. Optimize featured Image</h3><p> To do justice with SEO on your Facebook page, you need to customize your page by adding an avatar&#x2F;profile feature and utilizing the featured image section at its best. Along with photo, you can also add a video or a slideshow in the featured image&#x2F;banner section. Testimonials, team credits can be promoted in this section. Facebook emphasizes that cover photos shouldn’t be misleading, deceptive, or infringe any copyright.</p><h3 id="9-Manage-Customer-Reviews"><a href="#9-Manage-Customer-Reviews" class="headerlink" title="9. Manage Customer Reviews"></a>9. Manage Customer Reviews</h3><p> Customer interaction and engagement is vital for social media platforms and Facebook allows a great deal in this aspect. There needs to be a proper strategy for <a class="link"   href="https://www.business.qld.gov.au/running-business/consumer-laws/customer-service/managing-customer-reviews/tips" >management of comments and reviews, ads and posts <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Always make sure to respond to reviews, even if they are not what you have expected. It builds trust for your brand. You have the control over enabling or disabling customer reviews.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/manage-facebook-comment.JPG"                      alt="Manage Customer Reviews"                ></p><h3 id="10-Include-a-Call-to-Action"><a href="#10-Include-a-Call-to-Action" class="headerlink" title="10. Include a Call-to-Action"></a>10. Include a Call-to-Action</h3><p> Facebook SEO doesn’t typically bring results with regular content sharing. Having a Call-to-Action within your shared links on blogs and product pages on Facebook has more advantages. Click the link, comments, share the post are forms of call to actions here. A compelling CTA actually does the right thing for your post. Without a Call-to-Action, Facebook SEO concept is highly incomplete and hence it is the last and essential tip for you to optimize the SEO of your Facebook.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-call-to-action.JPG"                      alt="Include a Call-to-Action"                ></p><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p> From the above article, we are confident that you have got the goodies you wanted to take home and implement with your Facebook brand page. With such amazing features spread across social media, it’s obvious that gathering high ranks over search engine results won’t be a problem for your brand. Make sure to adhere to the specific guidelines under each section, while implementing SEO strategies on your Facebook brand page.

Being dragged through the media mud inspired the company to return to its cores and to offer a unique social media experience for all of its users once more. At the beginning of 2018, it became possible for the first time to <strong>record video calls on Facebook</strong> from an iPhone or iPad that has an iOS.11 or later version of the operating system installed.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-facebook-video-calls.jpg"                      alt="record facebook video calls"                ></p><p>Facebook was also one of the first social media networks that started offering the live video call option back in 2011.

Wondershare’s full-featured software provides a quick and easy way to record all your desktop activities in HD, even <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >4K video quality <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and it also features a video editing mode where you can brush up your videos.</p><p><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg"                      alt="Download Win Version"                > </a> <a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                > </a></p><p>Filmora can record videos via the built-in or an external webcam record system audio and audio from an external source, which means you record videos using professional equipment. You can start a new screen recording session by clicking on the software’s desktop icon and selecting the Quick Capture mode from the software’s welcome window. Before each session, you should choose the area of the screen you want to record, change the video’s frame rate, and choose the video and audio capturing devices. After you’ve adjusted the settings for the screen recording session, you can start a video call on Facebook and then hit the Record button to start capturing the video.</p><p>Pause or stop recording at any moment by clicking on the appropriate buttons in the software’s toolbar or by using the Hotkey F10. Once the session is complete, the video file you’ve created will be opened in Filmora video editing mode. The software’s video editor offers transitions, cutting, and trimming tools, as well as a rich selection of annotations, filters, and effects. Filmora video editor supports nearly all popular input video file formats, but you can only export Facebook video calls as MP4 or MOV files.

Even though the devices that run on iOS 11 operating systems can record Facebook video calls, in theory, this feature has been inactive recently. The feature functions sporadically even on the iOS 13 version of the operating system. The App Store doesn’t offer too many choices for capturing screens on iPhones and iPads.</p><p>When you install the app on your device, you should enable the Mirroring option in the AirPlay app to project the screen of your iPhone to a computer. Then proceed to make a video call on Facebook and hit the record button displayed on the top of the screen you projected from your phone. The Appersoft app offers support for MP4, FLV, or GIF files, and it can capture footage in 1080p and 720p video resolution. You won’t be able to edit your videos with Appersoft, but the App Store offers a lot of great video editing apps at reasonable prices.</p><h2 id="Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices"><a href="#Method-3-Record-Facebook-Video-Call-on-Android-Devices" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices"></a>Method 3: Record Facebook Video Call on Android Devices</h2><p>The Google Play Store provides a wide range of <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >screen recording apps for Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and most of them feature enough screen recording tools to enable you to record a video call on Facebook. <strong>DU Recorder</strong> is one of the best options at your disposal because it is completely free and contains no in-app purchases.</p><p>The app lets you adjust frame rates, capture HD videos, and control the video recording settings from the notifications bar. The phone’s front camera can be used to record yourself speaking during the video call on Facebook, and you can also record external sound with the app. Du Recorder offers an alternative storage option that enables you to store Facebook video call recordings in your chosen location.</p><p>Besides being a powerful tool for capturing a screen of an Android device, this versatile app also offers video editing and live streaming services. The Du Recorder’s screen capturing mode can also produce GIF files, which can produce popular social media content.</p><h2 id="Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger"><a href="#Method-4-Record-Chat-Videos-with-Facebook-Messanger" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger"></a>Method 4: Record Chat Videos with Facebook Messanger</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-videos-with-fb-messenger.jpg"                      alt="record videos with facebook messenger"                ></p><p>Android users can record all of their video calls from the Facebook Messenger app. You can start recording a video by launching the app and selecting the contact from the People With Messenger list in the Messanger tab. After you’ve selected the contact to whom the video will be sent, you should tap on the Camera button, located near the bottom of the screen, and then place your finger on the ‘Hold send button for video, tap for photo’ button and hold it there while recording the video.

Billions of users log into the site each day to check on friends, post status updates and read the latest news. And brands hope to use Facebook by working with influencers to reach their target audience.</p><p> We will help you learn how to increase followers on Facebook, which will allow your brand to take advantage of the power of social media marketing.</p><h2 id="10-Tips-on-How-to-Increase-Followers-on-Facebook"><a href="#10-Tips-on-How-to-Increase-Followers-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="10 Tips on How to Increase Followers on Facebook"></a>10 Tips on How to Increase Followers on Facebook</h2><h3 id="1-Create-Trendy-Content"><a href="#1-Create-Trendy-Content" class="headerlink" title="1. Create Trendy Content"></a>1. Create Trendy Content</h3><p> The simplest way to boost engagement levels on Facebook is by creating content that will trend. Whether it is a blog post, picture, video or even a meme, getting something trending can add a significant amount of followers to a page.</p><p> Companies can identify trending topics by seeing what is making the headlines at major sites, such as <a class="link"   href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/" >Buzzfeed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as it shows the topics that people are talking about at that moment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/increase-followers-trendy-content.JPG"                      alt="Create Trendy Content"                ></p><h3 id="2-Don’t-Ignore-the-Power-of-Email"><a href="#2-Don’t-Ignore-the-Power-of-Email" class="headerlink" title="2. Don’t Ignore the Power of Email"></a>2. Don’t Ignore the Power of Email</h3><p> If your company already has a significant email list for marketing purposes, <a class="link"   href="https://neilpatel.com/blog/the-social-email/" >targeting that email list <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to boost Facebook follower counts is a great idea. When you send a newsletter to your mail list, make sure you add a call to action regarding Facebook.</p><p> Encourage them to like your page so they can get the latest updates, discounts and other valuable content! Even if you get a percentage of those on the email list to follower your account, it will be a great help as you attempt to boost your follower count.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/email-increase-facebook-follower.JPG"                      alt="email increse facebook follower"                ></p><h3 id="3-Use-the-Facebook-Follow-Button"><a href="#3-Use-the-Facebook-Follow-Button" class="headerlink" title="3. Use the Facebook Follow Button"></a>3. Use the Facebook Follow Button</h3><p> Companies would be surprised at the amount of users who want to check out their social media pages, but are not sure if they exist. When someone visits your website, there should be a clear button present to indicate you are on that social media platform.</p><p> You can <a class="link"   href="https://www.dummies.com/business/marketing/social-media-marketing/how-to-activate-the-follow-button-on-a-facebook-personal-profile/" >create your own Facebook follow button <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, which you can place on various pages on your website. When users click on that button, they will go directly to your Facebook page. If they are already signed into the site, they just have to click the follow button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/follow-button.JPG"                      alt="facebook follow button"                ></p><h3 id="4-Create-Facebook-Videos"><a href="#4-Create-Facebook-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Create Facebook Videos"></a>4. Create Facebook Videos</h3><p> Statistics show that videos get a lot more traction and response from users on Facebook. Showcasing interesting video content about your company, products or services is a great way to gain more followers.</p><p> A Facebook video should be short and sweet - getting to the point immediately. Videos could tease products and services, announce discounts, or offer a behind the scenes look at how the company is run.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-video.JPG"                      alt="facebook video"                ></p><h3 id="5-Write-a-Great-Introduction"><a href="#5-Write-a-Great-Introduction" class="headerlink" title="5. Write a Great Introduction"></a>5. Write a Great Introduction</h3><p> Do not ignore the “About” section on your Facebook profile. When you fill in that section with all the relevant information, people will have an easier time seeing your page on search results pages.</p><p> Not only do you show up higher on Facebook searches, but also on Google search engine rankings. Information such as the company name, address, number, mission statement and other details should be included in the about section. The more people know, the better your profile comes across.</p><h3 id="6-Add-Hashtags-to-the-Post"><a href="#6-Add-Hashtags-to-the-Post" class="headerlink" title="6. Add Hashtags to the Post"></a>6. Add Hashtags to the Post</h3><p> Many companies still associate hashtags with Twitter. But they have become a critical part of interacting on Facebook as well. When a person clicks on a hashtag or enters it in the search bar, they can see all relevant posts with that hashtag.</p><p> When you are attempting to create trending content, <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/facebookmedia/blog/using-hashtags-on-facebook" >adding hashtags is a helpful way <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to get more people to notice and read your posts. Even people who do not follow your page will be able to see your posts, especially if they begin to trend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-hashtag.JPG"                      alt="use hashtag increase follower"                ></p><h3 id="7-Try-Facebook-Live"><a href="#7-Try-Facebook-Live" class="headerlink" title="7. Try Facebook Live"></a>7. Try Facebook Live</h3><p> Facebook Live offers a great opportunity for companies to live stream with their viewers, giving them personalized and behind the scenes access into operations.</p><p> When someone is following your page, they get a notification that you are in a live stream. They can even interact with the video with likes or by commenting. Live videos can also help build an audience as other people tune into your video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-live.JPG"                      alt="facebook live"                ></p><h3 id="8-Consider-Cooperating-with-Other-Influencers"><a href="#8-Consider-Cooperating-with-Other-Influencers" class="headerlink" title="8. Consider Cooperating with Other Influencers"></a>8. Consider Cooperating with Other Influencers</h3><p> Do not be afraid to engage with your audience. A Facebook account is not just for status updates or company information. It is a place where you can directly connect with your audience.</p><p> Answering questions, providing clever replies and other ways of interaction can help make your brand feel more personal. You can also interact with influencers who have a huge follower count, especially if you already have a positive working relationship with those influencers.</p><h3 id="9-Post-at-the-Right-Time"><a href="#9-Post-at-the-Right-Time" class="headerlink" title="9. Post at the Right Time"></a>9. Post at the Right Time</h3><p> When you post matters just as much as what you post, especially if you want to boost engagement. Studies show that if you post between 1pm and 4pm from Thursday to Sunday, you have a chance of getting around 20 to 30 percent more engagement.</p><p> The study showed that 3pm is best if you want more clicks, while 1pm gets you a lot of shares. Those who want to build up their follower count should focus on shares, which means posting around 1pm from Thursday to Sunday!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-posting-time.JPG"                      alt="posting time"                ></p><h3 id="10-Take-Risks"><a href="#10-Take-Risks" class="headerlink" title="10. Take Risks"></a>10. Take Risks</h3><p> Playing it safe is fine for major companies that already have a lot of brand awareness, loyalty and a huge follower count. Companies that want to make a splash and gain more traction should not be afraid to take risks with posts, replies and videos.</p><p> Taking risks does not mean saying something insensitive, rude or alienating. It is important to toe the line and to know when a bit of edgy humor can be helpful. Companies that can find the right balance will have a lot of success in gaining followers.</p><h2 id="Conslusionc"><a href="#Conslusionc" class="headerlink" title="Conslusionc"></a>Conslusionc</h2><p> The process of how to increase followers on Facebook is relatively simple, especially when it is broken down into steps. But it can be so important for brands to understand how they can boost their follower count and gain greater brand awareness on the social media platform. It will also help you connect with more powerful influencers, which will only boost your brand even more<img src="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" alt="![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)"><a href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg"                      alt="Download Mac Version"                ></a></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-AIMmjowaFs4/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABc/Y5UmwDaI7HU/s250-c-k/photo.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Liza Brown</p><p>Liza Brown is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Liza Brown</p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-how-to-watch-facebook-videos-on-my-apple-tv/"><u>[Updated] How to Watch Facebook Videos on My Apple TV?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-efficiently-explore-every-entry-facebook-profile-hunt-101/"><u>[Updated] Efficiently Explore Every Entry  Facebook Profile Hunt 101</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-surviving-the-social-shunning-fbs-invisible-rules-unveiled/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved  Surviving the Social Shunning  FB's Invisible Rules Unveiled</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/top-ff-video-grab-extensions-and-tools-for-2024/"><u>Top FF Video Grab -

Next, take some time to fill out your profile completely, and include a compelling description of your business.</p><p>Then, start posting relevant, high-quality content on a regular basis. As your page becomes more popular, you’ll start to see an increase in your Facebook ranking.</p><p>By following these simple tips, you can ensure that your Facebook page is working hard for you.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description"><a href="#Part-2-Use-keywords-in-your-Page’s-title-and-description" class="headerlink" title="Part 2.

Either way is pretty easy to do, and you can experiment with both when you begin to see which works best for you.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-do-you-want-to-create-ad-campaigns.jpg"                      alt="Facebook Campaign Creation Guide Types"                ></p><p>In the following part, I’ll show you the steps after clicking Select Guided Creation for detailed explanation.</p><p>At first, you’ll need to select campaign objective, which is what you would like to result from your video ad. Choosing the right one here can be tricky, but <a class="link"   href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1438417719786914" >here’s a guide to help you out <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Some possible marketing objectives to choose from include:</p><ul><li>Brand Awareness</li><li>Reach</li><li>Traffic</li><li>Engagement</li><li>Lead Generation</li><li>Conversions</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-campaign-marketing-objective.jpg"                      alt="choosing Facebook campaign marketing objective"                ></p><p>Depending on what exactly you want to achieve from your ad, you’ll select a particular objective. Each one aims to help you reach your goal - whether that’s video views, leading people to your website, or getting them to buy your product. Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.</p><p>You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad won’t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client. Once you’ve got that out the way, you can look at doing the actual creation work.</p><h4 id="2-Choosing-A-Format"><a href="#2-Choosing-A-Format" class="headerlink" title="2. Choosing A Format"></a>2. Choosing A Format</h4><p>Once you’ve gone through the initial info, you need to choose a format for your ad. You have a few specific options to choose from:</p><ul><li>Carousel</li><li>Single Image or Video</li><li>Collection group for Fullscreen Mobile Experience</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-ad-choose-format.jpg"                      alt="create Facebook ads - choose format"                ></p><p>Note: if you’ve enabled the Dynamic Creative option under Conversion in Ad Set tab, you’ll see the Single Image or Video format option only, since the Dynamic Creative allows you to upload individual images and headlines and generate combination automatically. Here, we’ll choose Single Image or Video format to show the next steps. Once you’ve got the hang of it, you can experiment with the other two.</p><h4 id="3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements"><a href="#3-Adding-Your-Media-Elements" class="headerlink" title="3.

Adding Your Media &amp; Elements</h4><p>Go to the <strong>Media</strong> section and now you can upload up to 10 images or videos and Facebook Dynamic Creative will generate multiple combinations; or, you can create slideshow or use the Video Template to create a new video with the Video Creation Kit.</p><p><strong>Add images to media</strong></p><p>Once you’ve begun to create your vid, you’ll find a button under the <strong>Media</strong> tab. Click Add Image and a window will open for you to select images - you can choose from the images on your account, your particular Facebook page you’re creating the ad for, your Instagram, or upload stock images.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-assets.jpg"                      alt="add Facebook ads image assets"                ></p><p>When adding images to media, remember to choose images that are the same size and orientation.

If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.</p><p>If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.</p><ul><li><strong>Get your point across ASAP</strong></li></ul><p>Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.</p><ul><li><strong>Keep it short</strong></li></ul><p>Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!</p><h3 id="Bonus-Why-you-should-place-Video-Ads-on-Facebook"><a href="#Bonus-Why-you-should-place-Video-Ads-on-Facebook" class="headerlink" title="Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?"></a>Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?</h3><p>As we said before, Facebook has billions daily users, and here are just a few reasons to start using this as a platform to get your videos out there:</p><ul><li>Facebook is regarded as the most important network for marketers, beating LinkedIn by a whopping 46%</li><li>Facebook video get, on average, over <a class="link"   href="https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/" >8 billion daily views <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li><li>Viewers are 1.5 times more likely to watch video on smartphones than on a computer</li><li>Video makes up just 3% of the content on Facebook, but has the highest engagement rate</li></ul><p>No matter what your business, video is a tool you should be taking advantage of, and with stats like these, Facebook is a great place to start getting your video ads out there!</p><h3 id="What-Could-You-Use-the-Creation-Kit-For"><a href="#What-Could-You-Use-the-Creation-Kit-For" class="headerlink" title="What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?"></a>What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?</h3><p>Whatever the purpose of your video, you’ll find the Facebook Video Creation Kit to be quite useful for you.
