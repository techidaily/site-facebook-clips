* First you need to hit the Elements tab in the tool bar and then choose the elements you want to use and drag them to the PIP track. For instance here I am selecting Element Emoji 8.

* Now you need to double click the above mentioned element on the timeline and then choose an animated effect for the Emoji effect. Now hit the OK button. One can also choose to hit the Advanced button for editing the Mask and Green Screen effect from the PIP edit.

 Note: It needs to be noted here that you will be able to zoom in and zoom out the timeline so as to view all the clips in the timeline with clarity. In case the duration of the video is lengthy then you can alter the duration of the still photos or cut some of the clips from the video footage. In order to use other effects like overlays and filters you just need to depend on Filmora.

#### 3\. Saving your video to the device

 Once you are done with the editing of your footage you need to hit the Export button for output. Since the Facebook profile video can only be uploaded through an iOS or Android smartphone, you will be required to select the Device in the left panel of the Export Window and then choose your device.
