## Part 1\. Why Is Your Video Partially Muted on Facebook?

Adding background music to your Facebook videos has its own significance. It has been observed that people enjoy videos that have background music. Sometimes, when the content and editing fail to impress the viewer, then it’s only the music that sustains the viewers’ attention and saves your content, but what if, with **Facebook, your video is partially muted**?

You will have a sudden shock because, generally, we are unaware of the reasons and factors that cause the partial mute to your videos. Let us share the reasons with you that why your **video is partially muted** on Facebook.

### 1\. Video Gets Reported

One factor that aids in your **Facebook video partially muted** is when your video is reported to Facebook in case it violates any copyright laws. You might hide and find a way to upload your content to Facebook, but if someone else reports your content to Facebook, then **your video is partially muted.**

### 2\. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music

Facebook has got some strict policies when it comes to copyrighted music. You cannot add any copyrighted music to even a small fragment of your video. Facebook exclusively prevents the rights of the artists who have created the music.

If you upload anything with copyrighted music, then either **your video is partially muted on Facebook**, or else the other options Facebook has is to remove the video.

### 3\. Someone Else’s Music

If you are using music that belongs to someone else, then Facebook is not going to tolerate that at all. If you complain that **your video is partially muted** Facebook, then you must have added someone else's music. In such cases, Facebook shows the song name as well as the singer's name so that we can know our fault.

Whenever you use the wrong music in your Facebook video, and it gets partially muted, then mostly we see a message on the screen saying ‘’Your video is partially muted because it may contain music that belongs to someone else. Learn More.”

![facebook video partially muted](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-1.jpg)

The issue of copyrighted music wasn't resolved, and the situation to take down videos was getting worse. So, by the year 2018, Facebook made a few deals with the big music industries like Universal Music Group and Sony Music Publishing. These deals gave users better options to add music to their content and to make them more interesting.

## Part 2\. What Can I Do When Facebook Muted My Videos?

It is not at all shocking to see that with **Facebook, your video is partially muted.** This mostly happens because of the strict and non-flexible policies that Facebook has. The question here arises that what could be done in a situation where **Facebook video partially muted?**

The coming section of this article will bring all the answers to you. We are going to talk about the solutions that could be adopted when Facebook mutes your videos.

### 1\. Warning Before Posting Video

In some cases, Facebook gives you a warning before you post your video. The warning message is something like this:

“Your video was not posted because it may contain music, audio, or video that belongs to someone else. Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don't have the rights to use all of the content in it".

If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the 'Post Video’ button. This is because you have the right to use the stock files in your videos.

### 2\. If Video is Muted

Another scenario is where you have posted a video on Facebook, but it has been muted, or Facebook partially removes music from your video. A warning message could be seen at this point, saying:

“Restore audio if you feel this is a mistake and you have the rights to use this content. Your video will be posted without any muted segments".

This might be because of the stock files you have used in your videos. For this, select the ‘Restore Audio’ option. Facebook grants you the right to use these.

Part 3: [How to Mute Facebook Videos?](#step3)

## Part 1\. Why Is Your Video Partially Muted on Facebook?

Adding background music to your Facebook videos has its own significance. It has been observed that people enjoy videos that have background music. Sometimes, when the content and editing fail to impress the viewer, then it’s only the music that sustains the viewers’ attention and saves your content, but what if, with **Facebook, your video is partially muted**?

You will have a sudden shock because, generally, we are unaware of the reasons and factors that cause the partial mute to your videos. Let us share the reasons with you that why your **video is partially muted** on Facebook.

### 1\. Video Gets Reported

One factor that aids in your **Facebook video partially muted** is when your video is reported to Facebook in case it violates any copyright laws. You might hide and find a way to upload your content to Facebook, but if someone else reports your content to Facebook, then **your video is partially muted.**

### 2\. Facebook Prevents the Use of Copyrighted Music

Facebook has got some strict policies when it comes to copyrighted music. You cannot add any copyrighted music to even a small fragment of your video. Facebook exclusively prevents the rights of the artists who have created the music.

If you upload anything with copyrighted music, then either **your video is partially muted on Facebook**, or else the other options Facebook has is to remove the video.

### 3\. Someone Else’s Music

If you are using music that belongs to someone else, then Facebook is not going to tolerate that at all. If you complain that **your video is partially muted** Facebook, then you must have added someone else's music. In such cases, Facebook shows the song name as well as the singer's name so that we can know our fault.

Whenever you use the wrong music in your Facebook video, and it gets partially muted, then mostly we see a message on the screen saying ‘’Your video is partially muted because it may contain music that belongs to someone else. Learn More.”

![facebook video partially muted](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-1.jpg)

The issue of copyrighted music wasn't resolved, and the situation to take down videos was getting worse. So, by the year 2018, Facebook made a few deals with the big music industries like Universal Music Group and Sony Music Publishing. These deals gave users better options to add music to their content and to make them more interesting.

## Part 2\. What Can I Do When Facebook Muted My Videos?

It is not at all shocking to see that with **Facebook, your video is partially muted.** This mostly happens because of the strict and non-flexible policies that Facebook has. The question here arises that what could be done in a situation where **Facebook video partially muted?**

The coming section of this article will bring all the answers to you. We are going to talk about the solutions that could be adopted when Facebook mutes your videos.

### 1\. Warning Before Posting Video

In some cases, Facebook gives you a warning before you post your video. The warning message is something like this:

“Your video was not posted because it may contain music, audio, or video that belongs to someone else. Post this video if you feel this is a mistake and you have the right to use all of the content in your video. Delete this video if you don't have the rights to use all of the content in it".

If this is the case you are facing, then stay strong and simply hit the 'Post Video’ button. This is because you have the right to use the stock files in your videos.

### 2\. If Video is Muted

Another scenario is where you have posted a video on Facebook, but it has been muted, or Facebook partially removes music from your video. A warning message could be seen at this point, saying:

“Restore audio if you feel this is a mistake and you have the rights to use this content. Your video will be posted without any muted segments".

This might be because of the stock files you have used in your videos. For this, select the ‘Restore Audio’ option. Facebook grants you the right to use these.

![restore facebook video audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-videos-partially-muted-2.jpg)

### 3\. In Case if Video has been Removed

There are chances that Facebook might even remove your entire video from Facebook due to any kind of copyright claim. Here, you are provided with all the sufficient details regarding the video and audio so that you can easily identify the problem.

If the claim is because of the stock files, then it is highly recommended that through your social platform, you should 'Dispute the Claimed Identity.' You should provide a link to the original track from the stock library.
