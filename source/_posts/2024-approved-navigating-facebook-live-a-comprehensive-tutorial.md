Not only does it intrigue the group members, but it also attracts other followers or joinees to the group. Here, we will mention the process of going live in a Facebook group both through the Facebook mobile application and PC.

### Through Facebook Mobile Application

At first, we will discuss the process of going live in a Facebook group through the Facebook mobile application.

* Now, tap on the Live button. Make sure to enter the video description and input any effects (if you want to).
* After that, tap on the "Start Live Video" option. Make sure to familiarise yourself with the policies of Facebook before the streaming.

It's possible to face a situation where you are unable to see the live option on your group. This can happen if the admin does not permit such posts in the group. However, if you are the group admin, permit the live option on your page.

### Through PC

While Facebook mobile application is a popular medium to go live on Facebook groups, PCs are no exception. If you are an admin, there are chances that you are using Facebook through the system. To go live on a group through PC, follow the steps given below

* Go to your News Feed and look for an option called "Groups." They are situated on the left menu.
* Now, choose the group where you want to live stream your video. From there, click on the "What's on your mind?" option. Then, click on the "Live Video" button.

* Make sure to enter the title and description into your live post. If you want, you can tag friends or members. You can also check in to the location or add any activity/feeling.
* On the bottom left side, click on the Go Live button.
