### **Always Pick a Unique and Strong Password**

Always create a unique and strong password for your Facebook account. It can involve alphabets, numeric, special characters and can be lengthy. Mix and match will make it very potent and difficult to use and remember.

Also, use different passwords for different online accounts. If you use the same password, every account can be compromised.

![facebook messenger hacking video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-11.jpg)

Never reply to messages which are unknown or click on links or watch doubtful videos. The links can automatically take you to dangerous sites. For example, the Facebook messenger hack video prompts you to open the video and leads to malicious websites.

If your friend asks for any personal information, their account may have been hacked, so stay alert and avoid sharing sensitive data through Facebook messenger.

### **Enable Facebook Security Features**

Facebook has improved security options. Turn on two - factor authentication, trusted contacts, security questions, recovery emails, personal identity. Update all the security features as they come in handy while recovering the account.

Obviously, it becomes vital to protect your Facebook data if you're a content creator and uploads videos. Facebook is a popular method of displaying creativity through video editing and talent. It can be dancing musical, nature, festive videos, or any type of editing.

![wondershare filmora video editing tool](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/2020-images/features-new/box_filmorax.png)

It's a significant loss when all your data is lost. But video creating and editing software like Wondershare Filmora lets you save your final video in the system.

It's an excellent tool for all content creators as you can directly share the video to Facebook. It's available for both Windows and iOS platforms. It's a very flexible and handy tool with the latest video editing features.

### **Review Your Payment Methods**

So, update yourself enough about Facebook beaches like Facebook messenger hack video and other types of trending techniques. Update your security and passwords and never compromise their security.

If you feel someone is messing up with your account, use the techniques mentioned above. A social media platform like Facebook holds your identity, so keep it secure and enjoy the platform for all the good things.
