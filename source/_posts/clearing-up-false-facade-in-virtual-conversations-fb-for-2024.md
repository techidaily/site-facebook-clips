### Facebook Video Scam Viruses

**Facebook video scam** has been at the forefront of viruses, where it has breached a lot of users' privacy with its simple yet effective technique of gaining personal information.

Hackers are quite successful in displaying such video scams as YouTube links that opened would redirect towards downloading a malicious file. Many people have reportedly explained the similarity with the original content, making the **Facebook video scam** one of the most threatening Facebook viruses.

### Fake Facebook Applications

People with little knowledge of Facebook applications have even breached their privacy with fake Facebook applications. The renowned icon has been copied and utilized in different forms, which, if downloaded, traps the user into the virus.

### What Happens After You Click the Link or Message

This Facebook virus propagates under the narrative of gaining access to personal information or putting malicious software into the targeted system that accesses the link. While circulated as a question, this virus operates over clicking the video link usually inserted across the message. Over clicking the link, a fake YouTube page or another significant look-alike platform opens up in a window that tricks the view of the people.

Most people believe in the originality of this fake platform and enter their credentials across it to give away their passwords to the hackers behind it. This imitation puts in a consistent threat of getting their remote server controlled by hackers. This malicious threat is all that puts your complete profile under an imminent threat.

The sites utilize HTTP instead of HTTPS, which is one of the simplest techniques to assume the link is a fake page to get out your information. The scam, however, extends to something beyond just getting personal information out of the user.
