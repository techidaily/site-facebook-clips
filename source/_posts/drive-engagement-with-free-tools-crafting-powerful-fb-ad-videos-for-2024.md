#### 1. Open Ads Manager

You’ll need to start in [Ads Manager](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/282701548912119), which is connected with your Facebook account and can be found on your home page in the left menu.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![where to find Facebook Ads Manager](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-ads-manager.jpg)

Click on the   **Ads**  tab, and the **Create** button to get started. You can’t miss it - it’s **bright green**! You’ll be asked if you want to choose Guided Creation or Quick Creation. Either way is pretty easy to do, and you can experiment with both when you begin to see which works best for you.

<a href="https://proteahair.pxf.io/c/5597632/1983634/23621" target="_top" id="1983634"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/23621-1983634" border="0" alt="" width="320" height="100"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1983634/23621" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![Facebook Campaign Creation Guide Types](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-do-you-want-to-create-ad-campaigns.jpg)

In the following part, I’ll show you the steps after clicking Select Guided Creation for detailed explanation.

At first, you’ll need to select campaign objective, which is what you would like to result from your video ad. Choosing the right one here can be tricky, but [here’s a guide to help you out](https://www.facebook.com/business/help/1438417719786914). Some possible marketing objectives to choose from include:

* Brand Awareness
* Reach
* Traffic
* Engagement
* Lead Generation
* Conversions

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://tokenmetrics.sjv.io/c/5597632/1864921/20702" target="_top" id="1864921"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/20702-1864921" border="0" alt="" width="1251" height="1042"/></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![choosing Facebook campaign marketing objective](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/choosing-campaign-marketing-objective.jpg)

Depending on what exactly you want to achieve from your ad, you’ll select a particular objective. Each one aims to help you reach your goal - whether that’s video views, leading people to your website, or getting them to buy your product. Depending on the objective you choose, your pricing could be different.

You will also be promoted to specify an audience that you want your ad to target. You’ll have to select info such as location, age, and demographic. This is especially important if you work in a specific area or with specific people - this way, your ad won’t target anybody who has no chance of being a potential client. Once you’ve got that out the way, you can look at doing the actual creation work.

#### 2. Choosing A Format

Once you’ve gone through the initial info, you need to choose a format for your ad. You have a few specific options to choose from:

* Carousel
* Single Image or Video
* Collection group for Fullscreen Mobile Experience

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![create Facebook ads - choose format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-ad-choose-format.jpg)

Note: if you’ve enabled the Dynamic Creative option under Conversion in Ad Set tab, you’ll see the Single Image or Video format option only, since the Dynamic Creative allows you to upload individual images and headlines and generate combination automatically. Here, we’ll choose Single Image or Video format to show the next steps. Once you’ve got the hang of it, you can experiment with the other two.

#### 3\.  Adding Your Media & Elements

Go to the **Media** section and now you can upload up to 10 images or videos and Facebook Dynamic Creative will generate multiple combinations; or, you can create slideshow or use the Video Template to create a new video with the Video Creation Kit.

**Add images to media**

Once you’ve begun to create your vid, you’ll find a button under the **Media** tab. Click Add Image and a window will open for you to select images - you can choose from the images on your account, your particular Facebook page you’re creating the ad for, your Instagram, or upload stock images.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![add Facebook ads image assets](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-assets.jpg)

When adding images to media, remember to choose images that are the same size and orientation. This will make your life easier and your ad look more appealing!

Also, it would be helpful to check the [image specs](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/image) and [video specs](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/video) before uploading.

If you want a slideshow ad that will simply scroll through the media you’ve selected and that you can add some extra text and info onto, head a little further down the page to add your text and links and finish up by clicking **Confirm**.

If you want to create a video, the process is a little different, but not much more complicated.

#### 4\.  Creating Your Video with Templates

If you choose use [video ad template](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to create a video, you will see lot of different options for you to choose from. There are square and vertical templates, you don’t need to worry about it too much because you can take the Square template and the Video Creation Kit will make a Vertical video as well.

#### 5\. Customizing Your Video Creation Kit Template

From here, you can upload your own images to fill the placeholders that the template will contain and customize the scenes. Simply click on each picture and choose **+Select Image** under the **Background** heading.

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!

### Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?

As we said before, Facebook has billions daily users, and here are just a few reasons to start using this as a platform to get your videos out there:

* Facebook is regarded as the most important network for marketers, beating LinkedIn by a whopping 46%
* Facebook video get, on average, over [8 billion daily views](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/)
* Viewers are 1.5 times more likely to watch video on smartphones than on a computer
* Video makes up just 3% of the content on Facebook, but has the highest engagement rate

No matter what your business, video is a tool you should be taking advantage of, and with stats like these, Facebook is a great place to start getting your video ads out there!

### What Could You Use the Creation Kit For?

This is great for **promoting products and services, introducing new businesses or ideas, or simply sharing something cool** that you’ve created with your friends.
