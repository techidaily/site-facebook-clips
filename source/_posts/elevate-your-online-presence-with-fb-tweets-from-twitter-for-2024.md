Fortunately, you can set your Twitter account and sync it with Facebook to kill two birds with a single stone. You can post Tweets to Facebook automatically as updates, sparing your personal intervention. Automatic posting of Tweets on Facebook ensures your friends on both platforms get your updates without the extra work.

## How to Post Tweets to Facebook – Step by Step guide
