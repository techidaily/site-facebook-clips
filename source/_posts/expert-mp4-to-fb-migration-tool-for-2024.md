## Part 2: Bonus Tip! Video File Formats Applicable on Facebook

As mentioned above, Facebook operates on a list of standards which include specific dimensions, sizes, aspect ratios, and video length. If the user fails to follow these video specs, the video wouldn't upload and will create complications. There are different specs for story videos, 360 videos, news feed, and Carousel video ads.

The standards have been set for a frictionless process. For instance, the dimension for Facebook stories has to be 500\*500 minimum, and its aspect ratio should be 1.91:1 â€“ 9:16\.
