![activate facebook two - factor authentication](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-10.jpg)

It's a compelling method of securing your account. However, when you enter your password to log in, you have to enter an additional code sent to your mobile to log in successfully. You must have your mobile with you.

### **Be Cautious of Unknown Devices and Networks**

In case of emergency, you may have to access your account from a public or unknown device. Make sure your log out and never click on **save the password** for this device.

Never reply to messages which are unknown or click on links or watch doubtful videos. The links can automatically take you to dangerous sites. For example, the Facebook messenger hack video prompts you to open the video and leads to malicious websites.

If your friend asks for any personal information, their account may have been hacked, so stay alert and avoid sharing sensitive data through Facebook messenger.

### **Enable Facebook Security Features**

Facebook has improved security options. Turn on two - factor authentication, trusted contacts, security questions, recovery emails, personal identity. Update all the security features as they come in handy while recovering the account.
