### Method 2: Ensure a Working Internet Connection

### Method 3: Disable Hardware Acceleration

Browsers use hardware acceleration to bring the perfect user experience for videos preview. However, it doesn't work all the time, so disabling it feels like the right choice.

### Method 5: Update the Browser to the Latest Version
