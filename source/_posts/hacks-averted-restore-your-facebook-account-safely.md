### **Always Pick a Unique and Strong Password**

Always create a unique and strong password for your Facebook account. It can involve alphabets, numeric, special characters and can be lengthy. Mix and match will make it very potent and difficult to use and remember.

Also, use different passwords for different online accounts. If you use the same password, every account can be compromised.

### **Activate two - factor Authentication**

![activate facebook two - factor authentication](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-10.jpg)

It's a compelling method of securing your account. However, when you enter your password to log in, you have to enter an additional code sent to your mobile to log in successfully. You must have your mobile with you.

### **Be Cautious of Unknown Devices and Networks**

In case of emergency, you may have to access your account from a public or unknown device. Make sure your log out and never click on **save the password** for this device.

In any case, you must log out from all devices if you feel your account may be unsafe and change the password immediately. In addition, avoid public Wi-Fi with no security for accessing your account.

### **Be Alert on Facebook Messenger**

![facebook messenger hacking video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-11.jpg)

If your friend asks for any personal information, their account may have been hacked, so stay alert and avoid sharing sensitive data through Facebook messenger.

### **Enable Facebook Security Features**

Facebook has improved security options. Turn on two - factor authentication, trusted contacts, security questions, recovery emails, personal identity. Update all the security features as they come in handy while recovering the account.

Obviously, it becomes vital to protect your Facebook data if you're a content creator and uploads videos. Facebook is a popular method of displaying creativity through video editing and talent. It can be dancing musical, nature, festive videos, or any type of editing.
