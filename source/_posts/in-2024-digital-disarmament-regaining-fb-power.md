### **Multiple Admins for Business Pages**

Don't be a single administrator to your business page. Multiple admins can help you recover your account in case of any emergency.

## **Conclusion**

Social media is a medium of entertainment, displaying your talent, creating bonds, and sharing memories. But everything comes with some terms.

So, update yourself enough about Facebook beaches like Facebook messenger hack video and other types of trending techniques. Update your security and passwords and never compromise their security.

If you feel someone is messing up with your account, use the techniques mentioned above. A social media platform like Facebook holds your identity, so keep it secure and enjoy the platform for all the good things.
