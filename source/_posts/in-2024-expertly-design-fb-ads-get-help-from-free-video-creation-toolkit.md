If you want to create a video, the process is a little different, but not much more complicated.

#### 4\.  Creating Your Video with Templates

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!

### Bonus: Why you should place Video Ads on Facebook?

As we said before, Facebook has billions daily users, and here are just a few reasons to start using this as a platform to get your videos out there:

* Facebook is regarded as the most important network for marketers, beating LinkedIn by a whopping 46%
* Facebook video get, on average, over [8 billion daily views](https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/04/facebook-video-views/)
* Viewers are 1.5 times more likely to watch video on smartphones than on a computer
* Video makes up just 3% of the content on Facebook, but has the highest engagement rate

No matter what your business, video is a tool you should be taking advantage of, and with stats like these, Facebook is a great place to start getting your video ads out there!

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

![video creation kit  templates ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-creation-kit-available-template.jpg)

The template names are quite specific to what each one does, so you should have no problem choosing what would suit you:

* Promote a Product
* Drive Product Discovery
* Sell Multiple Products
* Show Product Benefits
* Spotlight an Image
* Showcase a Square Image
* Showcase a Horizontal Image
* Feature an Image
* Highlight an Image
* Present a Horizontal Image
* Frame an Image

Each template shows how many images you can use and the duration of the video. For example, for a show product benefits video, the video will be 15 seconds with 5 – 10 images. Once you’ve browsed through them and decided which is best for you, click on **Customize** at the bottom of the window.

#### 5\. Customizing Your Video Creation Kit Template

From here, you can upload your own images to fill the placeholders that the template will contain and customize the scenes. Simply click on each picture and choose **+Select Image** under the **Background** heading. Be aware that you can’t use the images they’ve put in as placeholders, no matter how much you may like them!

### Tips & Tricks to Consider when creating video ads for Facebook

If you’ve never made a video ad using the Facebook Video Creation Kit before, there are some things that you should consider when creating your masterpiece:

* 85% of viewers keep the sound off in videos
* 47% of the value of a video ad is in the first three seconds
* The optimal length for videos are 15 seconds or shorter

Therefore, when creating your video, here are some things you should think about in order to make your ad as effective as possible:

* **Focus on visuals, not sound**

Use high-quality images (1280 x 720 pixels), and make sure they’re consistent in size and aspect ratio, or they will be automatically cropped. If you’re using video files, upload them in MOV or MP4 format.

If you are uploading music, make sure you are legally allowed to use it! You can select music in the Video Creator too.

* **Get your point across ASAP**

Don’t fill the first seconds of your video with fluff, because if someone isn’t engaged they’re going to miss the good stuff! Get your point across upfront, and make sure you grab the viewer’s attention from the start.

* **Keep it short**

Going over 15 seconds means that the amount of completed views is certainly going to be less. Pack as much as you can into 15 seconds. Remember - your viewer is likely to have many things vying for their attention - if you can hold onto it for 15 seconds, that’s success!
