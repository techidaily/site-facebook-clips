### 1\. Format

 Uploading videos over Facebook may not be an easy-peasy task, as the first thing one has to keep in mind is the video file types it supports such as WMV, FLV or 3GP etc. Also, if the file is not suppressed up to Facebook’s expectations then also the user would face problems in uploading the videos to your Facebook handle.

But, there are times when you try to upload the video on Facebook via these browsers but fails miserably. It may be because, that your web browser may not be upgraded to the latest version which may be the root cause of not uploading your video easily.
