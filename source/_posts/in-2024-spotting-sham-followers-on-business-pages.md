### Step 2: Calculate Engagement rate

[Engagement rate](https://trackmaven.com/marketing-dictionary/engagement-rate/) is nothing but the average number of engagements received by influencer for each post divided by number of followers. When an influencer has below 1% engagement, it implies involvement of few fake followers in certain amount. So, it is prevalent to track the numbers and do the calculation, so that there is no chance of fake followers on Facebook that can ruin your business.

### Step 3: Check tendency chart

Fake followers on Facebook can be detected if all of a sudden follower count increases. At times organic posts also garner high followers if it goes viral, but if the hike is not for a viral post, then it screams fake! When an unknown influencer has a sudden spike in followers and then a gradual decline, you need to understand that the influencer had a strong engagement rate. Nameless influencers can be through followers, comments and likes. Using third party tools you can gauge the tendency chart.

Knowing location also helps you in finding the origin of followers of an influencer who show interest in your product or brand.

When the influencer’s location and post topic seem unusual, you should know that there are chances of fake followers.
