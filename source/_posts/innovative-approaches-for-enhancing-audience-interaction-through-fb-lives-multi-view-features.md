Or the second option is the user-friendly ‘drag and drop’ tools that make everything easier for a beginner.

![split screen in filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-in-filmora.jpg)

You will find the Split Screen button on Wondershare Toolbar. Select this option and it will soon lead you to the library containing numbers of split-screen formats.

#### Step 4. Add videos to Split Screen

![split screen drop zone](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/split-screen-drop-zone.jpg)

#### Step 5. Video Sound Adjustment

Now as you have added all videos to your split screen, they will naturally start playing at the same time and their audio information will appear like noise.

Users can also mute both these videos and add one separate informative file in form of a soundtrack to the split-screen video. You can find such soundtrack files in the built-in media library of Wondershare. Once all soundtrack adjustments are done then hit the OK button to save the changes.
