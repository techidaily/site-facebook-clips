#### 1\. Reverse Image Search Facebook using Facebook Photo ID

Facebook provides each image with a unique Facebook Photo ID. Have you ever noticed that it has a weird number as its name when you download a Facebook image? Before using this method, it is important to keep something in your mind. After using this method, you will be redirected to a profile, you don't need to reach a profile of the person in the photo. But it might be a profile where this picture was originated. Another thing to be considered is that the profile you will reach after this reverse image search Facebook may contain limited information depending upon the profile's privacy settings.

**Step 01:** First of all, we have to locate the photo ID of the image. To do that, navigate to the image and right-click on it. Now select "Copy Image Address." It will copy the link to the image. Now paste it somewhere like Word or Notepad. To see how it looks like. You can see three sets of numbers that are followed by "jpg" or "png."
