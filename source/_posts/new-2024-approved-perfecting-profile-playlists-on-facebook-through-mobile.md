## Part 1: How to Add Music to Facebook Profile on iPhone and Android?

Here’s something you should be aware of before learning **how to** **add a song to** your **Facebook profile.** This function is only available for Android, iPad, and iPhone Facebook applications. This means that you can’t add music to your Facebook profile on the web Facebook account. Instead, there are just a few simple steps that you need to follow to get started.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Facebook account using the iPhone, iPad, or Android Facebook application.

**Step 2:** You will be taken to the feed page directly upon login in. You need to click on the profile picture that you can see on the top right.

**Step 3:** Once you are there on your profile page, scroll down a bit, and you will see the Music tab. You need to tap on that.

![Facebook Profile Music Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-option.jpg)

**Step 4:** After you do that, you will be taken to the Song page. Click on the + icon and search for the song that you would like to be added to your profile. Once you find the song, click on the Add option, and the song will be added.

## Part 2: How to Pin Music and Songs to Facebook Profile?

There’s another feature that Facebook allows you to use, and that’s pinning songs. When you pin a song, it will be added to your profile. You can pin one song at a time, though. To do that, follow the steps below:

**Step 1:** Go to your Facebook page and log in using your Facebook credentials. Please remember that this feature is only available for smartphones and iPad.

**Step 2:** Go to your profile page and locate the Music tab.

![Facebook Profile Music Option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-option.jpg)

**Step 3:** Now, click on the Music option. Each song will have three dots; click on that, and then you will see the option Pin to Profile. Click on that, and the song will be pinned to your profile.

![Pin music on Facebook Profile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pin-music-on-facebook-profile.jpg)

To check whether the song is pinned to your profile or not, visit your Facebook profile, and you will see it right below your profile picture.

## Part 3: How to Play and Listen Songs You Have Added to Facebook Profile?

By adding fresh songs to your profile, you will make your profile look and sound better. And it’s pretty apparent that after adding a song to your profile picture, you will like to hear it out as well. So, here’s how you can listen to the added song.

**Step 1:** Launch your Facebook profile on your smartphone or tab and go to your profile page.

**Step 2:** Once again, go to the Music option and click on that.

**Step 3:** You will see all songs that you have added to your profile. Click on any of the songs to listen to it. Moreover, you can click on any song to listen to it.

![Facebook Profile Music History](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-history-list.jpg)

## Part 4: How to Remove Unwanted Music from Facebook Profile?

Just like you can add songs to your profile, you can easily remove them as well. For example, you may be over the song and want to replace it with a new one. Here’s the step-by-step guide to doing that:

**Step 1:** Go to your Facebook profile page and not the feed page. On your profile, scroll down a bit and click on the Music icon.

**Step 2:** Click on the three horizontal dots right beside the song, and you will see some options.

**Step 3:** From the options, you need to click on the deleted song from the profile option. By doing this, the song will be permanently removed from your profile.

![delete Facebook Profile Music](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-music-track-from-facebook-profile.jpg)

You can remove one song or multiple of them.

## Part 5: Where Can I Find the Music Feature on Facebook Profile?

If you are someone who likes to express yourself through music, then Facebook can let you do that efficiently. This new feature rolled out a few years back. To find the add Music feature on your profile, you need to follow the following steps:

**Step 1:** First, launch your Facebook app and log in using your credentials. You will be taken to the feed page first. Once you are there, click on your profile to go to your profile page.

**Step 2:** Once you are there on your profile, you need to scroll down a little, and you will see the Music tab.

**Step 3:** Click on the Music tab. Since it’s your first time using the Music feature, the Music page will be blank.

**Step 4:** Click on the + icon that you see on the top right, and the music search window will appear. You can search for the songs you like to add to your profile here.

![Facebook Profile Music feature](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-profile-music-feature.jpg)

And that’s how the Music feature works on Facebook.

**Conclusion**

Music makes this world better, and we agree with that. Now that Facebook allows you to add a song to your profile, feel free to express yourself better because you never know who you might inspire just by adding a relatable song to your profile, right. Moreover, you can choose a song according to your mood and add it to your profile to reflect on your current feeling. The good part about the Music feature is that it has billions of songs ready to be added to your profile. No matter what kind of music you like or which singer you listen to, Facebook will have them all.

Now that you have learned **how to add a song to your Facebook profile** try it out yourself and add your favorite songs to your profile to impress everyone.
