 This app was also launched in the month of March and surprisingly it appeared like biggest competitor against Instagram Stories and Snapchat. However, few features like stickers, filters and posts disappearing within 24 hours etc are also same as that of other competing platforms.

 You can find Messenger Day feature directly in already existing Facebook Messenger and it will help you to check people that are active for real time chats. Reviews about Messenger Day reveal that this tool boosts thought sharing on social media platform. Users can easily share about what they are doing or what are their plans ahead.
