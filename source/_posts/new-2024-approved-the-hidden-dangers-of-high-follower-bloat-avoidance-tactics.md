Fake followers on Facebook can be detected if all of a sudden follower count increases. At times organic posts also garner high followers if it goes viral, but if the hike is not for a viral post, then it screams fake!

Nameless influencers can be through followers, comments and likes. Using third party tools you can gauge the tendency chart.
