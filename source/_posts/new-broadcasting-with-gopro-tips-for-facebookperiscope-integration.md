## Preparation for live streaming

Before you start live streaming from your action camera you will be required to install three apps- the GoPro App, the Live4 App and the Periscope App.

[The GoPro App](https://itunes.apple.com/in/app/gopro-app/id561350520?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)\-will allow you to control your cam, watch the photos and videos and share them on the move.
[The Live4 App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/live4-live-stream-gopro-iphone/id919921242?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)\-would allow you to broadcast the action sports videos from your GoPro or iPhone.
[The Periscope App](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/periscope-live-video-streaming-around-the-world/id972909677?mt=8)\-would allow you to broadcast and view what’s happening around the globe through live clips.

Once you have downloaded these 3 apps you will be required to go to your GoPro app and connect it to your action camera.

1\. Now you have to choose the device with which you want to connect the app.

![edit your title ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-your-title.jpg)

3\. In the 3rd step you will be required to tap the ‘f’ icon at the bottom of the right hand side of the screen. This would start to live stream your video on Facebook. You can decide if you want to share your location or not. You can also set your live stream as private or leave it open to the public.

![click the f ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/click-the-f.jpg)

## How to live stream GoPro to Periscope

Once you are done with your GoPro settings you can start live streaming via the Periscope app. Just open the app and tap the broadcast icon to start broadcasting
