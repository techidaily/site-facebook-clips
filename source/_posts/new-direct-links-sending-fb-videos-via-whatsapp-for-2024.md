## Part 1: Share Facebook Videos to WhatsApp on Android

First, let’s start with Android users who want to share Facebook videos with their friends through WhatsApp. There are many ways to perform this task, but we will address the two easiest methods to **share Facebook video to WhatsApp on Android** in this section.

### 1.1 Method 1: Manual Guide to Share Facebook Videos on WhatsApp

If you want to share a Facebook group video with a person present in the same group as you, you don't have to download that Facebook video on an Android phone. You can copy the URL of that video and send it to your WhatsApp contact. For further clarity, here is the ultimate guide to manually perform this function:

**Step 1:** Download the Facebook application on your phone and log in by creating your account. After signing in, explore the app and select a video you want to share on WhatsApp.

**Step 2:** After choosing your desired video, you can either select the option of "Share," which is adjacent to the "Like" and "Comment" option, or you can also tap on the three-dot icon that is displayed on the upper-right corner of the video.

**Step 3:** After following the previous step, you will see the option of "Copy Link" on your screen. Tap on this option to save the URL of this link on your clipboard.

**Step 4:** Afterward, close your Facebook app and open WhatsApp on your phone. Choose the contact you want to send this particular Facebook video. Now gently tap on the chat bar and hold it for a while to paste the copied URL. After clicking on the "Send" icon, your selected Facebook video will be sent to your WhatsApp contact within no time.

**Step 5:** You can also directly share the Facebook video on WhatsApp with your friend or family by clicking on the “Share” button and then selecting the option of “WhatsApp.” It will directly open WhatsApp for sharing the video link.

### 1.2 Method 2: Use a Reliable App to Download Facebook Videos

If the video you want to share is of a group where your friend or family is not present, it would not be accessible. So, it's better first to download the video, and then share it. In this method, we will use a reliable and third-party app, i.e., FastVid, to download videos directly from Facebook.

[FastVid](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fb.video.downloader&hl=en&gl=US) is one of the most reliable apps to download Facebook videos instantly. It has great reviews as the powerful Facebook video downloader as it is free from viruses and does not take much time to download. To use this method, we have mentioned the steps below on **how to share a video clip from Facebook to WhatsApp** through FastVid:

**Step 1:** To begin, go to the Play Store and download FastVid on your Android device using a strong Wi-Fi connection. Open the Facebook app and navigate to the video you want to download. Tap on the "Share" icon of that video and then select the option of "Copy Link." By doing so, the URL address of that video would be copied to your clipboard.

![install the fastvid app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/02/share-facebook-video-to-whatsapp-3.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now go back to FastVid, and there you will find the option of "URL," where you have to paste the URL address of the video. Once the link has been pasted, tap on "Download" to save the video on your Android phone.
