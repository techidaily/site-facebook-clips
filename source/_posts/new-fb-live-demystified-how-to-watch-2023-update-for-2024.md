Watching a Facebook live event can be easy on your desktop. Here's how you can do it.

**Step 1: Sign Into Facebook On Your Web Browser**

You can watch any Facebook live video on your PC or MacBook. First, you need to go to [www.facebook.com](http://www.facebook.com) and log in. After entering your credentials, you can set about finding a way to watch live streams.

![login to facebook](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/watching-facebook-live-1.png)

You can also watch live streams on your web browser without logging in. For this, you will need to go to [www.facebook.com/watch/live](http://www.facebook.com/live)/. This will let you search for the particular live stream you're looking for. Please note that you can watch the video to your heart's content. You will not interact with the video through emoji reactions or comments.

**Step 2: Select The Watch (TV) Icon**

You'll notice a row of icons at the top of the Facebook page. From those icons, select an icon that looks like a small tv. This icon will take you to the section with live streams and edited videos for upload.

Simply look for the magnifying glass icon on the top left-hand side. You can enter the relevant search terms and press enter/return key. Filter the search by hitting on the switch next to the live video. This will take you to the live stream you want to watch. If you want to watch live streams that just ended, you can. Look for videos without the red 'Live' tab on the top left corner.

**Step 6: Communicate on Chat**

You can communicate on chat quite easily. You may need to be logged in to your Facebook account for this function. The chats are visible on the right-hand side of the live stream. Sometimes, you'll see instructions from the creator. These are guidelines for interactions. These guidelines can help you stay engaged with the community around your favorite celebrity, influencer, and more.

**Step 7: Close the Live Video**

You can check out of a live stream by selecting the 'x' button to close the stream. This will close the live stream page. You'll be back on the 'Watch' page.
