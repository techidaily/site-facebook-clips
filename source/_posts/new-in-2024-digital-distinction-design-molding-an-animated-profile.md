## What is Facebook Avatar?

Social media giant Facebook has introduced Avatars that lets users create a cartoon-look-like version of themselves. Using FB avatar can help you create a digital character that is a virtual lookalike of yourself. It is a playful and fun way for users to create a cartoon avatar of themselves. Similar to Apple’s Memoji and Snapchat’s Bitmoji, this new feature allows you to engage and react more authentically with your friends and family across the app.

## Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?

Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.

Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.

FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.

![Bitmoji Collection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png)

To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.

Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.

## What is Facebook Avatar?

Social media giant Facebook has introduced Avatars that lets users create a cartoon-look-like version of themselves. Using FB avatar can help you create a digital character that is a virtual lookalike of yourself. It is a playful and fun way for users to create a cartoon avatar of themselves. Similar to Apple’s Memoji and Snapchat’s Bitmoji, this new feature allows you to engage and react more authentically with your friends and family across the app.

## Facebook Avatar Vs. Bitmoji Vs. Memoji: Which One is Your Favorite?

Facebook avatars, Snapchat Bitmoji and Apple Memoji are the different versions of the very same idea – each offering users a way to create cartoonish versions of their own and share with others in the conversation. Even though they are similar in their goals, they are much different in how they can be used and what their features are.

Perhaps, Apple’s Memoji is the best place to start since it stands out the most. An extension of Apple’s Animoji function, Memoji is an equivalent possibility that appears like a human as a substitute. iOS users can create Memoji as well as customize options like skin tone, pores, magnificence marks, eye coloration, hairstyle, and so forth. Since Memoji converts into a sticker pack on the device, it can be utilized in iMessage. But, using these stickers elsewhere like on Facebook, for instance, requires leaping through some hoops.

FB avatar and Bitmoji are a much nearer comparison. Even though they are different, they have oddly similar art styles. Whereas one has a heavily-inked, cartoon appearance, others have a CGI look that comes off as much more cartoony rather than being realistic. Unlike Memoji, Facebook and Bitmoji allow you to create full-body avatars.

![Bitmoji Collection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/bitmoji-collection.png)

source：support.bitmoji.com

To be frank, the major difference between the two is that Facebook’s version is the newest and it means that they lack the options of Bitmoji. Facebook’s avatar is restricted to FB, having very limited animation choices and do not enable for much customization. On the other hand, Bitmoji avatars can be utilized virtually anywhere – be it on PCs, Android phones, or iOS devices. And, there is a likelihood that Facebook will attain the customization choices of Bitmoji to some extent.

Facebook avatar is more beneficial to me due to its great convenience as its avatars do not necessitate the downloading of additional apps to use them.
