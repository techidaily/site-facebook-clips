## Part 1: What is the Blue Verification Badge

The blue verification badge is a seal of your identity. It proves that your pages have a real identity and not fake. Facebook has [three kinds of verification](https://www.facebook.com/help/196050490547892?helpref=popular%5Ftopics) – grey tick pages, blue tick pages, and blue tick profiles.

**The grey tick Facebook pages** represent various organizations and companies that have been verified by Facebook and confirm their real identity.

**The blue tick Facebook pages and Facebook profiles** confirm the identity of the public figures, media, and brands as per their claim. The badge confirms their official pages.

Confirming your Facebook identity verification is important because [it’s a quick sign that your business, brand, or profile is doing well](https://www.weboptimizers.com.au/blue-tick-verification/) and deserve to earn a verifying sign. When your customers or any users check a verified sign on your page, they know that the page they are looking at is not fake. The page is not created by any fraud or fan and it is the real profile or page of a person or company. When the clients seek customer service, the verified Facebook pages show that the company is serious about its client relationship and social media marketing. It also helps your page to rank higher on Google search as well as Facebook search.

**Are you eligible**? [Facebook verification is not allowed for all](https://www.facebook.com/help/1288173394636262). As per the Support Team of Facebook, the verified badge is only available for famous businesses or brands, journalists, media, celebrities, Government officials, sports companies, and people related to the entertainment world.

## Part 4: Why Facebook Didn’t Give Verification to Me

Facebook said verification can be accepted or rejected. The grey badge verification request takes around 48 hours and the blue badge verification request needs around 3 to 45 days to receive the Facebook response. In case, your verification request is rejected, it is due to the following reasons.

      * **Press releases or marketing is less** \- When your press is less, it is highly possible that your verification request is rejected as your business or page is not identified accurately. You must learn to get featured on Techcrunch, Forbes, etc. You can also [write a press release to get exposure](https://coschedule.com/blog/how-to-write-press-releases-examples-templates/). You may also hire my digital marketing agency for the same.
      * **Your Wikipedia is missing** \- In order to create a Wiki; you firstly require the high-quality press.
      * **Your identity proof is not up to the mark** \- When your reason for verification request is not very compelling or the ID provided by you is blurry or inappropriate, your request may get rejected.
      * **Missing Facebook Native Content** \- Facebook hates a dead page. So, it is important that your page is filled with relevant and great content for long.
      * **Verification is Strict** \- Facebook only verifies the popular pages and profiles easily if you can establish your popularity. It is very strict on who they verify.
