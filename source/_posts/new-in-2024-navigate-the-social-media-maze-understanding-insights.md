### 1\. Overview

 What is overview all about? The overview gives you a complete picture of your and your audienceâ€™s activities on your page for a week. The prime things that it covers are how many likes, comments, and shares your post received over a week, the number of people who viewed your content for one week, and the number of likes your page received. By understanding the measurement and performance of your page, you can check if any sort of pattern is developing, and then, delve deeper into the sections.

### 2\. Page Likes

 There are three basic metrics in the likes section.

 Firstly, the **page likes**, which captures the total likes on your page per day for 28 days.

 Secondly, the **net likes**, which captures the total new likes on your page subtracted by the total dislikes.

 Finally, the **certain times** your page was liked but broken by where it took place. In order to build your brand, you need to keep a track of your page likes and make sure that you are targeting the right people and connecting with them by targeting posts through relevant content.

### 3\. Post Reach
