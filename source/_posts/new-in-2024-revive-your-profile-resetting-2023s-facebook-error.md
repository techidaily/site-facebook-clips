The thumb rule is never to share your password with anyone. Unfortunately, certain people welcome the online breach by directly or indirectly sharing their login info.

![keep your facebook password safe](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-hack-get-your-account-back-2.jpg)
