Live streaming Xbox to Facebook isn’t as hard as it seems to be. The method for live streaming from Xbox to Facebook is fairly simple: all you need to do is stream the content of your Xbox to your computer by making use of a capture card. In case you don’t have a capture card you need to download one of those special software. Now you need to make use of a 3rd party app like Wirecast or Obs in order to live stream the screen of your desktop onto Facebook.

After living streaming videos to Facebook, you may want to [analyze the data of video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to attract more likes.

### Method 2:Streaming Xbox to computer with a capture card

You can find many [capture cards](https://www.elgato.com/en/gaming) in the market which would allow you to stream your Xbox onto your computer without altering its quality. HD60 Pro is one of those capture cards which offers perfect streaming and optimum control for an enhanced gaming experience.

## Use Wirecast or OBS to stream your desktop to Facebook

Once all is set up you can live stream you desktop screen to facebook, we are not going to give a full introdcution here, you can check _OBS setup here,_ and _Wirecast setup here._

[OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) \- is one of the best free and open source applications for live streaming and video recording. It comes with loads of useful features like real time audio/video capture, special filters for colour corrections, audio mixers and much more.

**Pros**\- Its is a powerful free software which includes the tutorials

**Cons**\- It doesn’t offer any support and it would take you a long time to master the settings.

![OBS](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/obs.jpg)

[Wirecast](http://www.telestream.net/wirecast/overview.htm) \- would allow you to capture, produce and stream content from a number of input devices including Xbox, iOS cameras, computer etc. The Wirecast Gameshow can be used for streaming high quality computer games in full HD.

**Pros**\- One of the best live streaming software, Wirecast can be used even by novices. This powerful and professional software comes with loads of exciting features

**Cons** It is way too expensive for normal gamers.
