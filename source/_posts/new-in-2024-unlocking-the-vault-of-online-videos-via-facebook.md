Social media apps have so much content that it almost becomes blurry while scrolling through it all. Out of all the apps, Facebook is the most used. It is one of the oldest apps with the most users and naturally has the most diversified content.

We scroll past hundreds of videos daily. Some are interesting; others are not. However, there are times when we like something so much, or we wish to watch something later. So, we tap the "Save Post" option, and it gets added to our saved list.

Social media apps have so much content that it almost becomes blurry while scrolling through it all. Out of all the apps, Facebook is the most used. It is one of the oldest apps with the most users and naturally has the most diversified content.

We scroll past hundreds of videos daily. Some are interesting; others are not. However, there are times when we like something so much, or we wish to watch something later. So, we tap the "Save Post" option, and it gets added to our saved list.
