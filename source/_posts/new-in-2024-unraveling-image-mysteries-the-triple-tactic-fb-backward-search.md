**Step 02:** Hit on the "Camera" icon beside the search box. Now click on Search by Google. It will provide you with two options for reverse image search, upload the image or paste the URL of the image. If you have the image saved on your device, then upload it on Google.

If the Facebook profile that contains the image doesn't have any restrictions, you can see the Facebook profile in the search results. It will show you all the related websites and pages that contain the same image. It will lead to the profile that contains the image you have searched for.
