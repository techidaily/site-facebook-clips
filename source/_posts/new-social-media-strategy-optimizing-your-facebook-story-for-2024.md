If you are on Facebook, you might have seen people sharing stories with a clickable link. Of course, you may be already aware that you can share videos, written content, and photos on Facebook stories that last for 24 hours, but there’s another thing that you can do: share a clickable link.

[Facebook stories](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are one of the best ways to engage with people, especially with your target audience. Facebook stories are viewed by more than 500 million people daily, and it is predicted that the number is soon going to increase. So, if you want to know **how to add a link to** the **Facebook story,** you have come to the right place. This article will help you understand how it’s done. So, let’s begin!

* [Part 1: Benefits of Adding Links to Facebook Story](#part1)
* [Part 2: Adding Clickable Link in Facebook Story Using Facebook App](#part2)
* [Part 3: Adding Link to Facebook Story Using WhatsApp](#part3)
* [Part 4: Adding YouTube Video Link on Facebook Story](#part4)
* [Part 5: Adding A Swipe Up Link on Facebook Story](#part5)

## Part 1: Why Should You Add A Link to Your Facebook Story?

Like we said, these clickable links that people post on their Facebook stories allow them to have better engagement with their audience. For example, let’s say you have uploaded a recent video on YouTube and you want more people to watch the video; embedding a clickable link on your Facebook story will allow your viewers to watch that YouTube video directly. In addition, your audience will not have to type anything to search for your content.

Adding a link to a Facebook story can be a boon for companies to enhance their sales. This link can boost CTR, click-through rate. Companies should think about adding a link related to their services and products in order to grow their engagement, strengthen their relationship with their prospective audience, and build brand awareness. Facebook stories are not like the regular posts that you see. It appears right on top of people’s feed.

## Part 2: How to Add Clickable Link in Facebook Story Using Facebook App?

Note: Before we share the steps that you need to follow, please keep in mind that you can only share clickable links on your Facebook story if you have a Facebook page and not through your personal account.

**Step 1:** Open Facebook and log in. Now, open the Facebook page. Click on the + icon on the profile picture of that Facebook page. Once done, you will see the option to create a story. Please click on that.
