## Part 2: Bonus Tip! Video File Formats Applicable on Facebook

As mentioned above, Facebook operates on a list of standards which include specific dimensions, sizes, aspect ratios, and video length.

The standards have been set for a frictionless process. For instance, the dimension for Facebook stories has to be 500\*500 minimum, and its aspect ratio should be 1.91:1 – 9:16\.
