Lastly, the ads that play at the end of the video are known as Post-Roll Ads. These ads are mostly shown to those viewers who have not received any pre-roll, mid-roll, or image ad.

As we have mentioned, ads might appear before, during, or after the video. So hence, **FB instream ads** have various formats. Let us introduce them to you.

**Pre-Roll Ads**

Ads that are played before the video starts are known as Pre-Roll ads. People who seek out content actively are mostly shown these ads. The more you seek out content, the more you receive these ads.

**Mid-Roll Ads**

Ads that play during the video are referred to as Mid-Roll ads. If your video has natural breakpoints, then this ad format works best.

**Image Ads**

Some ads are displayed under the content. These ads are static and are known as Image Ads. These types of ads work best for videos that cannot adjust mid-roll ads.

**Post-Roll Ads**

Lastly, the ads that play at the end of the video are known as Post-Roll Ads. These ads are mostly shown to those viewers who have not received any pre-roll, mid-roll, or image ad.

## Part 2\. Instream Ads for Live
