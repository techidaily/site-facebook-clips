![The Ford GT... Ford v Ferrari](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-trending-videos-on-facebook-files-1.jpg)

This video was among the most viral videos as it features a clip from the infamous 2019 Movie ‘Ford vs. Ferrari.’ It has amassed 8.5 million views and 92 thousand likes and reactions, plus 1.9k comments.

The Facebook video’s main highlight is how Ken Miles, one of the main characters, qualifies to rate for the major racing event ‘Le Mans.’

The vice president of Ford Motor Company, Leo Beebe, is shown arguing with Ken Miles, a hot-headed British racer and a struggling mechanic who helps Carroll Shelby build the Ford GT40 Mk for Henry Ford II.

As the prototype car is ready, Leo Beebe opts to send another racer to test it in its first racing event, ‘Daytona,’ instead of Ken Miles himself.

However, just at the right time, Henry Ford II appears for a test drive of the machine he has invested $9 million in, and Carroll Shelby takes him for a spin. Dumbfounded by the car’s potential, Henry Ford II allows Ken Miles to race Daytona on Shelby’s request overriding Leo Beebe’s order.

Towards the end of the clip, Ken Miles appears to be losing the Daytona event, but with a secret trick up their sleeves, Carrol Shelby clears Miles to push the car beyond the 7000 RPM tachometer red line.

Everyone is skeptical about pushing the car to its limits, but Ken Miles, knowing what he built, pushes the car in the last lap and, to everyone’s surprise, passes all the cars and wins the event. The end of the video shows his team shouting and cheering him up and a disappointed and fumed Leo Beebe.

It was a viral video that trended on Facebook for quite some time as it featured a re-enactment of a social experiment.

The video is a short film that stars a lady in a wheelchair who dines in a restaurant. The restaurant staff misbehaved with her and discriminated against the woman based on her disability.

They assume that the critic might get a bad impression if anything is out of order or unusual, and it may become the reason for their restaurant’s failure.

The staff insults her in many views including misbehaving, not taking the right order, providing her with the wrong food, and asking her to switch tables despite being pre-booked.

Towards the end, when the lady has had enough, she stands out of her wheelchair, and to everyone’s surprise, she is the food critic by the name of Brooke White, who imitated to be in a wheelchair and test the restaurant staff.

The manager, waiter, and owner are flabbergasted by the critic’s disguise and immediately start apologizing, but the damage is done! This viral video was a lesson for all of us not to discriminate against anyone based on their disabilities, looks, or any other thing and treat everyone equally with respect.

![Disabled Woman Was Refused in Service at the Restaurant](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/8-trending-videos-on-facebook-files-3.jpg)

This video was uploaded to the Facebook page ‘DramatizeMe’ and gained over 3.7 million views, 63k likes, and 1.2k comments. It is titled ‘Disabled Woman Was Refused in Service at the Restaurant.’

It was a viral video that trended on Facebook for quite some time as it featured a re-enactment of a social experiment.

The video is a short film that stars a lady in a wheelchair who dines in a restaurant. The restaurant staff misbehaved with her and discriminated against the woman based on her disability.

They assume that the critic might get a bad impression if anything is out of order or unusual, and it may become the reason for their restaurant’s failure.

The staff insults her in many views including misbehaving, not taking the right order, providing her with the wrong food, and asking her to switch tables despite being pre-booked.

Towards the end, when the lady has had enough, she stands out of her wheelchair, and to everyone’s surprise, she is the food critic by the name of Brooke White, who imitated to be in a wheelchair and test the restaurant staff.

The manager, waiter, and owner are flabbergasted by the critic’s disguise and immediately start apologizing, but the damage is done! This viral video was a lesson for all of us not to discriminate against anyone based on their disabilities, looks, or any other thing and treat everyone equally with respect.

She asks the dad to name three consecutive days without using the words Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, to which the dad thinks for a minute and, to her surprise, replies with the correct answer that is ‘Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow.’

The last riddle almost gets the dad when the daughter asks, ‘There are 30 cows in a field and 28 (20 ate) chickens; how many did not?’ Dad is stuck for a few minutes and struggles to figure out the answer, but he eventually gets it.

The viral video picturizes the beautiful relationship with her dad, and the viewers have enjoyed the sight of it along with the riddles! To watch the video, click on the link:
