The key to great customer service is promptness and knowledgeability. This is where chatbots come in handy. You can get more bang for your buck with a chatbot. If you have a customer service team, then you can use chatbots to filter out basic, tedious, and repetitive questions. Additionally, the chatbot can make the customers' experience feel personalized.
