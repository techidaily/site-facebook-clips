Step 1: For starters, open your Chrome browser and click on three vertical dots located in the top right corner. Click on "Settings" from the context menu that appears.

**Method 2: Disabling Browser Extensions**

The browser extensions are often added to work effectively. But they do not work all the time and create problems for the normal workability of the Facebook app. Disabling the browser extensions is the right way to clear the **FB full-screen problem.** The steps are:

Step 1: Launch your Chrome browser and head to the three dots. Click on "Settings" and then head-to-head to the "Extensions" from "Main Tools."

![open chrome extensions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/facebook-video-full-screen-5.jpg)

Step 2: Disable the extensions by toggling them off.

**Method 3: Disabling Hardware Acceleration**

The enabled Hardware Acceleration enhances the operation of different programs used on the browser. However, it does interfere with Facebook usage and video previews. It is smart to disable the Hardware Acceleration and then find out if the problem was resolved.

Step 1: Open your Chrome browser and click on "Settings" from the three vertical dots. Click on "Advanced" from the left panel.
