Live streaming Xbox to Facebook isn’t as hard as it seems to be. The method for live streaming from Xbox to Facebook is fairly simple: all you need to do is stream the content of your Xbox to your computer by making use of a capture card. In case you don’t have a capture card you need to download one of those special software. Now you need to make use of a 3rd party app like Wirecast or Obs in order to live stream the screen of your desktop onto Facebook.

After living streaming videos to Facebook, you may want to [analyze the data of video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to attract more likes.
