* First you need to hit the Elements tab in the tool bar and then choose the elements you want to use and drag them to the PIP track. For instance here I am selecting Element Emoji 8.

![filmora elements emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

* Now you need to double click the above mentioned element on the timeline and then choose an animated effect for the Emoji effect. Now hit the OK button. One can also choose to hit the Advanced button for editing the Mask and Green Screen effect from the PIP edit.

* The size and the position of the Emoji element needs to be adjusted accordingly.

* The result can be checked by hitting the Play button from the Preview window. If you are satisfied with the result you can move on to the next step.

 Note: It needs to be noted here that you will be able to zoom in and zoom out the timeline so as to view all the clips in the timeline with clarity. In case the duration of the video is lengthy then you can alter the duration of the still photos or cut some of the clips from the video footage. In order to use other effects like overlays and filters you just need to depend on Filmora.

#### 3\. Saving your video to the device

 Once you are done with the editing of your footage you need to hit the Export button for output. Since the Facebook profile video can only be uploaded through an iOS or Android smartphone, you will be required to select the Device in the left panel of the Export Window and then choose your device.

![export output](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-output.jpg)

 Note: Remember that the export isn’t going to transfer the videos to your mobile device directly. The video is going to be stored in the local hard disk.

## Section 2: Uploading the Profile Video to Facebook

 Now that you have created a stunning profile video with the help of the Wondershare Filmora software, it’ time for you to upload it on Facebook. You can upload up to 7 seconds of video footage for your Facebook Profile Video. The profile video is going to appear in the place of your profile picture and everybody will be able to view it. Presently you are allowed to add only one profile video from your Apple or Android smartphone. Let us now find out how to upload the edited video to your Facebook page.

#### How to add a Profile Video from iPhone

* Visit your profile page and tap your existing profile video or picture
* Now tap ‘Select profile video’ and select the video you want to upload
* Choose the video you just exported to your phone
* Now hit the Use button

#### How to Add a Facebook Profile Video from Android

* Visit your profile and tap the existing profile pic or video
* Hit the ‘Select profile video’ button and choose the video from your phone
* Hit the Next button and then hit the bar in the bottom of the screen for selecting the thumbnail for your video
* Now hit the Use button.
