Before setting up a thumbnail, there are certain limitations provided by Facebook for the streamers. The platform allows uploading JPEG or PNG as a thumbnail across the video. Along with that, it needs to be less than 3MB in size.

Users who wish to add a thumbnail across their stream must follow the steps explained below.

**Step 1:** You need to direct yourself into the Creator Studio to go through the settings of your stream. Lead to the "Creative Tools" section from the left-hand panel and select "Set Up Live Stream" from the window featured on the front.
