### 2\. Know your objective

You need to know your goals no matter what you need to do. One video only needs one objective. Viwers will get lost if you want to have more stuff in your one video. The best part of goal is you can find your first idea when you don't know what to do. For creating Facebook vido, you need to be specific if you decide to make product video, which means the only goal is to shooting your product.

### 3\. Make it short

Usually, long video needs more patience of viwers. It is not advised to make long video if your video quality is not high. For safty, under 30 seconds short video is the best. You need to encourge viwers to click or doing some action in the short video.
