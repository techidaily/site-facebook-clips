## The Easiest Way to Download Videos from Facebook

Whenever we watch an interesting video on Facebook the first thing which comes to mind is how we are going to save it. This is because there are no download options or links for saving them. However, you need to be a little smarter and trick the browser into thinking that you are using Facebook from your mobile device. To find out how to save Facebook videos read the steps below:

1. Right-click the video and choose ‘Show video URL’. Now copy the URL and paste it into the address bar of your browser.
2. Click enter and open the page.
3. Now delete the ‘www’ from the URL and type the letter ‘m’.
4. Hit the enter button and open the mobile version of the video and hit the play button. If the video starts to play then it's time for the last step.
5. Right-click the video and choose ‘Save video as’.
6. Now the video has been saved on your computer so that you can view it as many times as you want.
