For starters, it is important to know that you can add music to the Facebook stories only if you are on Android or iPhone. Secondly, you cannot use the browser to carry out the process as it involves the workability of the Facebook mobile app. Hence, bring your smartphone to continue the process.

### Step 2: Creating a Story

Moving on, launch your Facebook. Click on "Create a Story" found on the top of the interface beside the stories of your followers. After clicking on creating the story, Facebook allows the users to choose from a wide variety of options.

### Step 3: Browsing for the Song

The options include boomerang, text, poll, music, and photos. Press on "Music" from there. Facebook presents a list of tracks to choose from and makes your story appealing. The search bar can also be used if you look for music in a particular genre.
