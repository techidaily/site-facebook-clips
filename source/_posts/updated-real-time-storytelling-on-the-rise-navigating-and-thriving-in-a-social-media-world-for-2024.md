## Part 1: What is Facebook Story and How Does It Work?

### 1. What is Facebook Story?

Facebook stories are a fun, fast, and efficient way to share and consume content. It is a feature that allows the users to add filters and effects to photos and videos and post them to the stories. Users can also share text posts, music, and animations with other users using the feature. Once you publish the content to your stories, it is available to view for 24 hours. Facebook stories from your friends and followed pages appear at the top of your News Feed that applies to both the web version and the Facebook app. Hope, we helped answer your question what is the Facebook story?

### 2. When was Facebook Story Released?

Facebook rolled out stories feature on March 28, 2017, for both mobile and desktop versions bringing the popular format for sharing photos and videos to more than 1.65 billion people. The move was a part of an effort to dampen the momentum of Snapchat, which invented the stories format in 2013\.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
When you share content via a Facebook story, it does not appear in your News Feed. Instead, it appears at the top of the Facebook News Feed in the app and the desktop version. Your stories are visible to your selected audience for 24 hours only. Any photo or video you add to your Facebook story will also appear in your story on Messenger.

### 4. How does Facebook Story Work?

If you are looking for how to use Facebook story, then let us tell you that Facebook stories work similarly to Instagram stories. They appear at the top of your News Feed. To view someone’s Facebook story, tap on the profile picture circle. While viewing a story, you can respond with a direct message.

When you open a Facebook story, it appears on full screen. You can tap the left or ride side of the screen to skip backward or forward. Unseen stories have a blue ring around them, and the viewed ones are grey. If you do not wish to see a certain user’s stories, you can mute them, and they will not show up on your Story feed. To mute a user, click on their story, then tap on the three dots at the top right corner, and click on mute to hide the stories.

### 5. What are the Differences Between Facebook Story and Facebook Feed?

Facebook offers two options for users to share their views, pictures, and videos, the News Feed, and Stories. However, many people are confused and wonder about the difference between the two.

News Feed is the core functionality of Facebook and has been a part of it since the beginning. When you post an update here using the “What’s on your mind” box, it appears on your wall/timeline. To find new content, you need o scroll down.

![How Facebook Feed Posts Look Like ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/facebook-post-feed.jpg)

On the other hand, Stories is a feature introduced a few years ago. When you add content like the photos or videos here, it shows as a slideshow. The option is like a catalog, when you finish watching one story, the next story starts playing automatically.

Step 1 – Login to your Facebook on a web browser, and at the top of the News Feed, you see Create Story with your profile picture.

Step 2 – Tap on the + button, and you get two options, Create a Photo Story and Create a Text Story.
