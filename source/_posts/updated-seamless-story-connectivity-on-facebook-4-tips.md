## Part 4: How to Add YouTube Video Link on Facebook Story?

If you have found an interesting video on YouTube or want to promote your YouTube video on Facebook, then adding the YouTube link to your Facebook story will benefit you. In fact, adding a YouTube link to your Facebook story can be done directly from YouTube. Here are the simple and easy steps to follow:

**Step 1:** First, launch the YouTube app on your mobile device or open it on a browser, and find the YouTube video and open it. Here I will show you how to share a YouTube video link to Facebook Story with a browser.

**Step 2:** Click on the Share button. You will see the embedded link and other options. Next, you need to click on the Facebook option.

You will be redirected to the Facebook app. There you will be asked if you want to share it as News Feed or Your Story. You need to click on the Story option, and in this way you will share the YouTube video to Facebook Story.

And you will see the Story with YouTube video link at the top of your Story section.

## Part 5: How to Add A Swipe Up Link on Facebook Story?

Facebook stories offer another feature, which is known as the Swipe Up Link. On some pages, you might have seen that their stories ask you to Swipe Up, and once you do that, you get redirected to a website. This fantastic feature is available for Facebook pages with a good number of followers and many likes. Else, the swipe-up link feature is available for people with the Blue tick, which means celebrities, brands, and famous people. Here’s how to add a swipe-up link to your Facebook story.

**Step 1:** Log in to your Facebook account and go to your Facebook page to add the swipe-up link.

**Step 2:** Now, click on the + icon that you can see on the profile picture. After that, you need to click on the Create Story option.

**Step 3:** On your story page, you see a link icon. Click on that, and you will be able to add the link you want to add to the story. Choose any of the buttons, and the link will now be ready.

Please note that the swipe option will be visible to your audience only after you have added the link.
