#### Step 3.Complete Profile Information

 Now it is time to update your major profile information. This is quite interesting!

#### Step 4.Upload Profile Photo

 The first most important task is to upload your suitable profile photo to make your profile recognizable to your friends. Facebook can automatically crop uploaded photos to desired size so you need not to worry about its dimensions. Just pick your most adorable photograph and make it your profile photo. As per recent updates made to Facebook platform, users can also [use a 7 second video to make their profile video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It can be added from Android or iPhone.

 In case if you want to update profile video from iPhone then simply visit your profile and tap on profile photo/video. Choose the options to either capture a new Profile Video or make selection from your device library. Once you choose, tap on use and update.

 Those who are working on Android can simply move to Profile, tap on profile photo/video, select new photo/video from device, choose video thumbnail from bottom portion of screen and tap use.

#### Step 5.Add Cover Photo

 Choose a beautiful photo cover of yours to make an eye catching Facebook banner. This selection can be also cropped or easily repositioned by using Facebook editing tools. Facebook also allow users to update a [GIF image](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) as Facebook Cover. Besides, Facebook allows you to [change cover photo later](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### Step 6.Update your basic info

 Finally you have to update the ‘About’ section of your profile. Add your contact information, gender, age, and religion as well as relationship status as per your choice. Update few attractive quotes to make it more interesting.

#### Step 7.Find your Friends

 In this last step you are now ready to make connections online. Facebook can help you to get connected with your friends and relatives. To do this, you need to search for your desired profiles and then send friend requests. Here are two techniques to send friend requests:

**Search:** You will find a search bar on the top of screen, enter name of your friends over there and as soon as you find them hit the “send friend request” button.
