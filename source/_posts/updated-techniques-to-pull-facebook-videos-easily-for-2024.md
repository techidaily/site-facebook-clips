## Downloading Videos Posted by Yourself

If you want to download any videos posted by you then just follow the steps given below:

1. Go to the Photos section of your Facebook page and locate the video you wish to download.
2. Click on the video and open it.
3. Once the video is opened you need to hit the Options button right below the video.
4. Under the Options menu, you will find 2 download options- Download HD and Download SD. In case the video had been captured in high definition then click on Download HD and if the video had been recorded in standard definition, hit Download SD.

**Note**: when posting a video, you can [use the Facebook scheduler](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to set a posting time if you want to have time to do more important stuff.

## The Easiest Way to Download Videos from Facebook

Whenever we watch an interesting video on Facebook the first thing which comes to mind is how we are going to save it. This is because there are no download options or links for saving them. However, you need to be a little smarter and trick the browser into thinking that you are using Facebook from your mobile device. To find out how to save Facebook videos read the steps below:

1. Right-click the video and choose ‘Show video URL’. Now copy the URL and paste it into the address bar of your browser.
2. Click enter and open the page.
3. Now delete the ‘www’ from the URL and type the letter ‘m’.
4. Hit the enter button and open the mobile version of the video and hit the play button. If the video starts to play then it's time for the last step.
5. Right-click the video and choose ‘Save video as’.
6. Now the video has been saved on your computer so that you can view it as many times as you want.

1. Go to the Photos section of your Facebook page and locate the video you wish to download.
2. Click on the video and open it.
3. Once the video is opened you need to hit the Options button right below the video.
4. Under the Options menu, you will find 2 download options- Download HD and Download SD. In case the video had been captured in high definition then click on Download HD and if the video had been recorded in standard definition, hit Download SD.

## The Easiest Way to Download Videos from Facebook

Whenever we watch an interesting video on Facebook the first thing which comes to mind is how we are going to save it. This is because there are no download options or links for saving them. However, you need to be a little smarter and trick the browser into thinking that you are using Facebook from your mobile device. To find out how to save Facebook videos read the steps below:

1. Right-click the video and choose ‘Show video URL’. Now copy the URL and paste it into the address bar of your browser.
2. Click enter and open the page.
3. Now delete the ‘www’ from the URL and type the letter ‘m’.
4. Hit the enter button and open the mobile version of the video and hit the play button. If the video starts to play then it's time for the last step.
5. Right-click the video and choose ‘Save video as’.
6. Now the video has been saved on your computer so that you can view it as many times as you want.
