**The grey tick Facebook pages** represent various organizations and companies that have been verified by Facebook and confirm their real identity.

**The blue tick Facebook pages and Facebook profiles** confirm the identity of the public figures, media, and brands as per their claim. The badge confirms their official pages.

Confirming your Facebook identity verification is important because [it’s a quick sign that your business, brand, or profile is doing well](https://www.weboptimizers.com.au/blue-tick-verification/) and deserve to earn a verifying sign.
